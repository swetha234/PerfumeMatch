He loves the perfume also but agrees that after a short while it fades. I have other perfumes that I can smell for days. When you spray your top for example, on laundry day you can smell the perfume when you put the top in the wash. This perfume doesn't stay on material either. I will continue to buy it and use it because it does have a very nice alluring scent and I love the way it makes me feel. It actually \"lifts you up\" I have noticed. It must do \"something\" to your Endorphins. Try it you WILL love the scent also.\n",

My mother smelled it, and gave it a try(she kinda liked that smell). It constantly becomes like a watered down flowery, soapy skin scent ( w/ very, very little projection) on her(weird). After 2-3 hours it's gone on her(not even a skin scent). She can wear it in hot humid sun and its a total different scent and projection. On me 3 stars, for her 5 stars. Defiantly can be unisex fragrance. I'd say older female(my moms late 50's), but i could see a young 30's+ pull this off. Young to middle age males can make this work. \n",

He did stop and ask. He said he wanted to buy it for his wife and he loved the clean fragrance. I offered him a bottle that I keep in my purse to take home and give it to his wife to try.

That was the last time she bought the perfume, as it was not available in or near my sleepy little North East town; she returned to her essential oils. I saw this and remembered how empowered and wonderful she felt. Being older and having retired from nursing, she doesn't wear a lot of fragrances any more. I bought this for her for Mothers Day.

Dry, but not austere. Sensual but not maudlin. Dominant, but not oppressive. Professional, but not sterile. Adventurous, but not dirty. Elegant, but not stuffy. Effortless, but not lazy. Fun, but not flippant. Serious, but not brooding. I could go on. The amount of character Aventus holds in perfect balance is....astounding. This is a fragrance that represents the very archetype of refined masculinity. An olfactive allegory. Marcus Aurelius is probably the only man who is really qualified to wear Aventus, but hopefully whoever sprays it on is inspired to strive to become the man it was made for.\n",

      "Versace Crystal Noir. As expected from a Versace perfume it is a strong scent. The strength is still balanced so it's not out of hand. It is a mature and sophisticated scent suitable for classy diner parties. There is a pleasant sweet floral scent along with the overall strong perfume. The stronger notes fade faster than the sweeter ones so after awhile it becomes more of a lighter scent with a slight stronger touch instead of the other way around when it's first applied which still smells good just in a different way. The mini bottle has a plastic stopper in the large wide cap which makes it easy to grasp and the bottle itself is stout so it is easy to place down on a surface.\n",

People say stuff like this ALL THE TIME in reviews, but I’m honestly kind of a fragrance snob and I’ve smelled and owned many, many scents. Currently this is in my top five favorites. For a scent to become my favorite, it has to have serious depth, complexity, and class, and this one has them all. It’s exquisitely earthy, but opens up with a blast of fresh orange. Its got hints of stone, wood, earth, and while that may not sound great to hear, trust me, it’s absolutely incredible and versatile, fresh and clean yet deep, woody and complex. \n",
