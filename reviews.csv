1,"D & G Light Blue by Dolce & Gabbana Very fresh and pleasant citrus smell, I keep it in my car, great for any occasion.",5
2,The best! Period. I have many different colognes but this is by far my most used. I have had many compliments from many women and men on what I’m wearing. Best use is during a hot summer day. For the price I can’t see anyone regretting this purchase. Will buy again soon! ,4

5,"Enternity for men is very refreshing,crisp and pleasant. ",5
5,Love the scent - the size of the bottle & the price. Thanks Fragrance ;),5
5,"The Eternity by Calvin Klein has a very masculine, classic scent. Although, it doesn't last long on my skin at least and doesn't diffuse much. Never had anybody asking what cologne I'm wearing with this on myself, so there you go!",3
5,LOVE IT! SMELLS SO GOOD,5
5,Eternity makes me feel Nausea ? I purchased the wrong scent meant to purchase Eternity Intense . ,2
6,The name Versace says it all and for half what you will pay in the department stores.,5
6,"Versace Eros is my top pick for date nights. This fragrance has a luxurious aroma, with masculine citrous and fresh apple notes, that provides you with an instant boost of confidence upon misting your body. One or two spritzes are enough to last all night and even into the next morning. I would highly recommend purchasing this product. ",5
6,"Versace EROS, Truly love wearing this scent. Pleasing and masculine. Last all day.",5
6,It's the first time trying the versace eros and I wasn't disappointed. I love it.,5
6,L like Versace very match ,5
7,The Mont Blanc Legend series of colognes are all winners with slightly different personalities for your different moods and times. Great scents that will draw comments and compliments. And at a great price. You can't miss with this!!,5
7,Do not waste your money buying this piece of crap like i did. One of the worst colognes you can buy. ,1
7,"Legend is by far the best cologne I have ever purchased. I also bought Versace Eros when i bought this, but Legend just blows Eros out of the water. It's not overly powerful like many colognes out there, but it definitely stands out. I can't really describe the smell. So if you want to test it out, Sephora carries this and a few other stores you can find at the mall.",5
7,"Fragancia con aroma varonil, madura, para uso nocturno, longevidad 6 horas aproximadamente. Buenas criticas femeninas.",5
7,"Mont Blanc legend is pretty good , I never tried before ! But I’m freaking happy give my mint blanc legend . Thanks ",5
8,"Escape for women is a great scent, the price was unbeatable ",5

9,"I have been buying CK One for years - because all the women that have been in my life, love its' scent (on me). Yes, I do wear other colonges, but this one is far and away the most popular with the ladies.",5
10,I'm very happy with my CK Obsession quick delivery I will be ordering again soon.,5

10,"Love Calvin Klein Obsession. It's a favorite of me, my wife, my sister-in-law and my therapist! I bought my therapist his own bottle. A++++ !",5
10,I purchased Calvin Klein Obsession the price was outstanding and it's a great cologne,4
10,This is a great product at an even better price. I use it daily.,5
11,Versace Bright Crystal smells delightful. I'm very pleased with my purchase. ,5
11,Versace Bright Crystal is my very favorite! This is my third purchase of this fragrance and I love it! It is light and oh so feminine. A true and constant fragrance of mine. ,5
11,I absolutely love this perfume!! And I will definitely buy more ,5
11,I purchased the small bottle of Versace Bright Crystal because I was not sure I would like it. Well all I can say is smells heavenly and I will purchase again for sure. Versace makes the best perfumes for women. I have the Versense and Euro Pours by Versace also. I have not been disappointed in any of my purchases by Versace and I get a lot of compliments.,4
11,Just awesome! smells awesome!,5
12,The euphoria perfume is awesome. My girlfriend loves it and the delivery time was quick.,5
12,Love sensual sent of Euphoria and you can't beat these prices. ,5
12,Euphoria is one of my favorite fragrances and the price was much better than anywhere else I checked ,5
12,"Euphoria has been my go-to scent since it first came out. I had a lady follow me through a store to find out what perfume I was wearing, and have been complimented on numerous occasions! Love it, love it, love it!!",5
12,Euphoria is my wife’s favorite perfume!! Still smell it when she gets off work!! The price is the best I’ve seen d ,5
13,"Do not blind buy! I did based on all the raving reviews thinking it would smell sweeter like pear and toffee. But the patchouli is VERY strong. Granted it gives it great projection (which for me being so feminine give me a headache, lol!) I like patchouli in YSL, and Chloe, but in Jimmy Choo it smells extremely masculine, like a cologne or a barber shop. I passed it along to my husband for after shower/bedtime. I still love fragrancenet, great bargains nowhere else can be found!!",2
13,"Jimmy Choo eau de parfum, I love this fragrance. I receive so many complements. You smell nice, what fragrance are you wearing. I appreciate the many complements. I have been wearing Jimmy Choo for over 20 years. What I like is it is a soft fragrance, not, a loud over bearing smell! I have brought other perfume only to leave them on the dresser, and back to my Jimmy Choo! Love, Love, Love this fragrance! ",5
13,Jimmy choo is cool!,4
13,Love this perfume! This is my go-to perfume for when I am going out and I always receive compliments when I wear it. I would consider this a fresh powdery scent but still unique. Also it has great staying powerr and a little goes a long way. Too much can be overpowering. ,5
13,"Arrived quickly and I love the perfume, smells awesome! (Tester purchased) :)",5
14,"At first I didn't like the smell of Azzaro Chrome but it eventually grew on me and now I wear it pretty often. It has a very clean and crisp scent to it, perfect for summer. I'd recommend grabbing a bottle and trying it out for yourself, worth it for the price!",5
14,Great product. One of my favorites. ,5
14,Cologne is a personal item and what suits one may not suit another. However I do think that Chrome is by far the best value in the market place for men.,5
14,Azzaro chrome is a lovely fragrance!Last a whole work day on me with great compliments from colleagues.,5
14,I got my oldest son Azzaro Chrome he loves it he's been wearing it all the time. He had a bottle of got out of his car and it shattered all over. Mom surprised him with a new bottle.,5
15,I don't know about this one. It's a very weird smell . But my girlfriend loves it. ,2
15,D&G Light Blue is still the best! I've been using it for 3-4 years and still really like it.,5
15,"I was skeptical at first due to the prices, but was referenced by someone i trust. Fragrance guys promote this site as well. I read all the negative reviews also. I am not a robot and im here to tell you i got the real deal holy field for 60 dollars. That batch # showed June 11, 2018 with 23 months of general shelf life. Everything is legit and quality. i cant believe it and i couldn't be happier, i will be using this site again!! ",5
15,"Recieved my D&G light blue the other day. Very quickly I might add, it's a superb product. Absolutely love it.",5
15,"D&G Light Blue Okay this kind of has a Giorgio Armani Acqua di Gio (original) nuance with a lot more depth!!! If you do not have both bottles side by side you would say it's one or the other. If you have neither stick with D&G light blue. What can I say great fresh scent, not Earth shattering, but a solid fragrance! Any age male can pull this off, super universal for any occasion.",5
16,Love the smell. Nice every day scent. ,5
16,I really messed up buying this. It reminds me of my great grandmothers perfume. It doesn't smell like scent for men. I think it is a matter of taste regarding this one but I recommend buying a small size if you want to try it. I will not buy this one again.,1
16,Man is the truth love smell last long time,5
16,I'm buying this every other month for my husband. It is his favorite!,5
16,"I bought this cologne as a gift for my husband for Father’s Day and he LOVE it!!! At first, I thought I bought the wrong one but when he opened it was very well pleased!! And the smell lasts a long time!! ",5
17,OBSESSION I LOVE THIS PARFUM EVERYONE ALWAYS TELLS ME I SMELL GOOD,5
17,Obsession always generates compliments. I even had the bag boy tell me what I was wearing because I smelled so good! Just never tire of the great woodsy scent.,5
17,I’ve loved Obsession when introduced in the 80’s and still do!!,5
17,I just keep ordering....I love it... I get many many compliments on Obsession perfume .. price is wonderful ... ,5
17,"This purchase was a throw back, as I used this during my younger days. Decided to give it another go and so happy I did. Satisfied with both the price and the fluid ounces. Absolutely love this fragrance.",5
18,Atomizer. Just wish they would be in various colors for my different perfumes. ,5
18,"I purchased my Perfume Travel Atomizer 18 months ago and it is still working properly. I am a frequent traveler, so I wanted a container that would be approved through TSA. It's small enough to fit in my cosmetic bag and hold a good amount of perfume to last me for 3 days.",5
18,This travel atomizer last 7 days with 2 squirts/day. I used it for 14 days on a recent trip to Europe. Loads quickly and the liquid is fully compartmentalized with no leaks. Works great.,5
18,Tried out the perfume travel atomizer. The 1st 1 I got filled up great but would not spray properly. I called customer service and they sent out another one free of charge. The 2nd one worked perfectly and I am highly satisfied. Wonderful mist of spray!,5
18,Perfume atomizer really wanted to be able to fill it with ombré rose an found out it has to be a pump bottle would really like to get one for those kind of bottles like it but can not use for my favorite perfume ,4
19,Burberry is a different smell than I usually wear but I love it!,5
19,I only buy my Burberry from here. This is my fall/winter scent and Amazing Grace is my spring/summer scent. Best price by far. I also buy all I need for Christmas gifts every year. Its the best way to save. ,5
19,I will always love ❤️ You ...Burberry with all my heart ❤️ !,5
19,Burberry is my new favorite perfume. I am 72 and i gave a bottle to my daughter in law (32 yrs old) and found out she has used it for 10 years. So it is a perfume for old and young. ,5
19,I’ve been wearing this for 20 years. I love this scent. I will forever be a Burberry Girl. ,5
20,Nice scent but a little too synthetic smelling,3
20,"While I tend to gravitate towards the more powerful Eau De Parfum version of Sauvage, the EDT version is also awesome. Spicy yet fresh, masculine but not overpowering, projecting but not overwhelming....Sauvage is a perfect men's fragrance. You need this!",5
20,Smells great. A fresh scent that’s not overpowering. Great for anytime of year day or night. I’d definitely purchase this again.,5
20,I love this fragrance. It last a long time and smells so good. ,5
20,Great cologne. At a discount.!,5
21,I have purchase many Nautica colognes for men from fragrancenet that have smelled amazing but this one smells like Fabreeze air freshener spray. Not happy at all.,1
21,I purchased this for my brother and he loves it ,4
21,I use Nautica Voyage have used it for a while before I realized it was for a man. I'am a woman and everyone loves the smell of it on me. Not to strong and stays all day. Who would have ever thought women could wear men's cologne. My husband loves the smell of it on me.,5
21,I love this perfume!,5
21,Nautica voyage smells really good its a clean light cologne. ,5
22,I love the sent and like that it is not overpowering and it stays with you throughout the day,5
22,Love white diamonds perfume brought my daughter a bottle for her birthday and cant get over the size of the bottle she can spray as much as she wants with this size white diamonds been her favorite perfume since the 80s ,5
22,White Diamonds is the best! I always get compliments everywhere I go. Strangers in the grocery store have come up to me and asked what are you wearing you smell so good! Love White Diamonds!,5
22,"Elizabeth Taylor White Diamond. Great fragrance. Love this perfume, and get asked a the time what I'm wearing. ",5
22,"I totally Love it, the scent stays with you for a long time. I get many compliments. Thank you so much, there’s nothing like the scent of White Diamonds!",5
23,Clinique Happy is my very favorite fragrance. I wear it for myself it makes me feel good.,5
23,"I've worn Happy for years. Every time I try a new fragrance, I always find myself back to Happy. I love it!!!",5
23,Love it and stay on for all day ,5
23,"CLINQUE HAPPY IS THE ONLY PERFUME I WEAR, I LOVE THE SCENT AND MY ASSOCIATES KNOW WHEN I'M AT WORK . THEY SAY MY PERFUME LEAVES A TRAIL SO THEY KNOW WHEN IM IN THE BUILDING .",5
23,"I received Happy, Aromatics elixir and obsession. I was shocked at the size of the products considering the amount I paid for them. I assumed that they would be small, but they are enormous. I plan to buy a lot of birthday and Christmas presents from you. I couldn't be more pleased.",5
24,"La Vie est Belle is a great scent. The only thing is it does NOT stay with you. I find myself constantly having to put more on. I have asked my Fiance for his opinion. He loves the perfume also but agrees that after a short while it fades. I have other perfumes that I can smell for days. When you spray your top for example, on laundry day you can smell the perfume when you put the top in the wash. This perfume doesn't stay on material either. I will continue to buy it and use it because it does have a very nice alluring scent and I love the way it makes me feel. It actually ""lifts you up"" I have noticed. It must do ""something"" to your Endorphins. Try it you WILL love the scent also.",4
24,"I loved discovering this site. My mother in law loves La Vie Est Belle perfume, I ordered it fans it was delivered quickly. So easy and when I gave it yo my mom in love, she was so happy. This is a perfume that smells like love. It brings a smile to my face every time. Thank you so very much for helping me show love and gratitude to an amazing lady ",5
24,I love this perfume. Get many compliments on it. Thanks ,5
24,"I was beyond excited to get this but let down . The reviews made it sound wonderful. Its very musky not floral. I wanted to make sure it wasnt just me so I had 3 friends smell it, at different times, and they all said the same thing. It smells like an old lady. Not appealing at all. I threw it out. Oh well. ",2
24,Absolutely love this fragrance. ,5
25,Great smell for the fall and winter. ,3
25,The best of the best it’s in a class of its on I bought years ago before most wasn’t aware of the wonderful scent and to this day it’s at the top of my list next to polo red extreme one million is extraordinary. ,5
25,Paco Rabanne 1 Million fast delivery Great Product Will buy again,5
25,"I really like this scent on me. Most colognes don't last that long on me, but this one lasts most of the day. It doesn't take much either so the bottle should last me a long, long time. I only use two sprays and that is all I need for the whole day...",5
25,Paco rabanne 1 million is the best I had dust far ,5
26,"Great price and get a lot of compliments at work , long lasting thru the day at work",5

31,I really love the smell of Coach..but it doesn't last long...,3
31,A beautiful soft powdery woody floral. I’m not a fan of sweet fragrances and even though it’s floral the musk softens it. The rose and gardenia are sublime. There is a lovely sandalwood dry off. ,5

Also, I have never, and I mean never, had so many compliments, by men and women alike, on any cologne I have ever worn!. I'll put it on in the morning, and mid afternoon I'm still getting asked what I'm wearing, that it has such a pleasant, not overbearing scent. I have Polo and Armani I wear once in a while, but my go to brand is Paul Sebastian !",5

36,Pleasure I can’t even say enough about this I love it and can only afford it thru this site it’s a wonderful smell and makes me feel so clean and fresh.,5
36,I've always loved Pleasure by Estee Lauder. It has a mild flowery and fresh scent. Feminine and not hard on the ’nose’ ,5

38,"Brother in law likes this, He has done so much for me, this won't begin to repay him. But smells great!! My husband when he was living loved it also!",5
38,I recently bought joop cologne for my friend and unfortunately he wasn't satisfied he said kind of smell like an old person it didn't go so well on that one but happy with the others eternity and coach will see next time,3
38,LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!!,5
38,"JOOP Defiantly strong on me. 2 sprays and projects for days!! To me it comes off slightly sweet, flowery and very incense, maybe even a slight patchouli vibe. It becomes cloying, and almost sickening, because it does not die down on me. Not for hot days(on me). It's not bad, but not for me. My mother smelled it, and gave it a try(she kinda liked that smell). It constantly becomes like a watered down flowery, soapy skin scent ( w/ very, very little projection) on her(weird). After 2-3 hours it's gone on her(not even a skin scent). She can wear it in hot humid sun and its a total different scent and projection. On me 3 stars, for her 5 stars. Defiantly can be unisex fragrance. I'd say older female(my moms late 50's), but i could see a young 30's+ pull this off. Young to middle age males can make this work. ",4
38,I love the smell and so does everyone in my life I'm walter Levine ,5
39,Cool Water has been my favorite since my ex gave it to me 20 years ago . I received lots of compliments even strangers. I was shouting it's ñame wherever they asked!,5
39,I love Cool Water it smells so clean and fresh. Everyone compliments me on it.,5
39,This perfume is great. I am 30 and growing up I remember my father wearing the men's version daily when he went to work. I always loved it. I recently found it here and ordered a bottle. Brings all the warm memories of my childhood and father back. Women always ask me what I am wearing. It lasts ALL day with no issue. There's also a boy at work who just clings to me and loves the smell. Everyone loves the smell. Will order again once I run out. I ordered the 6.7 oz bottle and don't wear it daily so it'll last a while for me. ,5
39,I received my package. This is a big savings compare to mall prices!!!,5
39,"My daughter introduced me to Cool Water several years ago and i am still wearing it every day. I must say it is a scent that actually makes complete strangers walk up to me and ask what perfume I am wearing. I just had an experience where a gentleman walked up to me and said I have walked past you 3 times and i said to myself, if I pass that woman once more I am going to ask her what perfume she was wearing. He did stop and ask. He said he wanted to buy it for his wife and he loved the clean fragrance. I offered him a bottle that I keep in my purse to take home and give it to his wife to try. What a compliment from complete strangers. I would highly recommend Cool Water for Women by Davidoff. It wears well day and night.",5
40,I had never tried Jimmy Choo Man before. I found it quite fragrant and would order it again.,5

42,Versace Yellow Diamond is one of my favorites. ,5

45,I've been wanting to buy DKNY Be Delicious for a couple of years now. I absolutely love this scent and a great price as well. ,5
45,This is my fresh sporty go to scent. I love wearing it in the summer. It has depth at the end that is the sandlewood and vanilla they describe. A little goes a long way. Love this designer value! ,4

45,I get so many compliments on the fragrance ,5
46,"SUNG (Alfred Sung)... I’ve worn this exquisite scent since it was introduced many years ago—it’s my signature scent. In fact, it is so compelling that I’ve been stopped nearly every time we’re out and about by people following an aroma they wanted to know more about—needless to say SUNG has been copiously complimented everywhere it goes with me. Astonishing.",5
46,"When I was in high school, my mother wore essential oils. When I went off to college she began taking trips to New York City. On one of her journeys, she bought this colognes. I came home one weekend from college after mom bought this and it smelled wonderful on her. She loved the way it made her feel (following the divorce from Dad) and said she felt 'sexy' in it. That was the last time she bought the perfume, as it was not available in or near my sleepy little North East town; she returned to her essential oils. I saw this and remembered how empowered and wonderful she felt. Being older and having retired from nursing, she doesn't wear a lot of fragrances any more. I bought this for her for Mothers Day. She LOVED it! She forgot how much she enjoyed wearing it. I even bought her another Alfred Sung fragrance she had not been able to find. I am so happy to hear the youthful joy in my mother's voice again. Thank you FragranceNet!!",5
46,"Sung: i was so looking forward to this product based on reviews and product description. The first few minutes of wearing are scrumptious, but then the green floral and musk kick in and it is just not for me. ",1
46,"Sung for women is the most amazing smell....I love wearing it all the time. My husbands wants me to wear it at night while in the house watching TV. By the price of it I was very skeptical to order it, but it is so great and I highly recommend it to all. ",5
46,I GUESS AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF USING SUNG I HAVE TAKEN SMELLING OH SO GOOD FOR GRANTED BUT THIS SUNDAY MORNING AT CHURCH EVERYONE HAD A LITTLE EXTRA SMELL AND ALL HAD SUCH NICE THINGS TO SAY -- THIS IS MY ONLY SPRAY I USE AND HAVE FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS !!!,5
47,"I went on line looking for the longest lasting men's perfume/cologne. Creed was by far the most recommended cologne. I love the cologne, but it doesn't last any longer than the many other colognes I've used. Very disappointing. As a baby boomer, I remember the old cheap high school colognes lasting all day. What is the problem with the colognes these day, too much water????",3
47,I was very pleased with the Green Irish TWEED and De Marly but the Creed ADVENTUS was disappointing it didn't seem to be long-lasting or as strong as the other two not sure if it was not an older bottle or not either way no more ADVENTUS purchases here.,2
47,"I have over 12 different cologne's right now. Creed is by far #1. get compliments from both women and men. It also is long lasting. will purchase again when it's gone,,",5
47,Real thing smells great ,5
47,"Nine years after its release, Creed Aventus is still The King for one reason: character. Despite batch variations, Aventus always maintains a strength and balance of character that NO other fragrance has ever had. Mature, but not old. Youthful, but not immature. Sweet but not saccharine. Dry, but not austere. Sensual but not maudlin. Dominant, but not oppressive. Professional, but not sterile. Adventurous, but not dirty. Elegant, but not stuffy. Effortless, but not lazy. Fun, but not flippant. Serious, but not brooding. I could go on. The amount of character Aventus holds in perfect balance is....astounding. This is a fragrance that represents the very archetype of refined masculinity. An olfactive allegory. Marcus Aurelius is probably the only man who is really qualified to wear Aventus, but hopefully whoever sprays it on is inspired to strive to become the man it was made for.",5
48,Marc Jacob Daisy Haven't used this one yet but have the big spray bottle. This is my absolute favorite fragrance right now. I first smelled it when the sample came in a magazine and LOVED it then. Then I took a chance and order the really tiny one from FN and LOVED it. I then decided to get the big spray bottle so my husband bought it for me for Christmas and I've loved it and worn it ever since. Nice to be able to get a small size like this to refresh without having to carry the whole big bottle. Get it you won't be disappointed.,5
48,Absolutely my wife’s favorite fragrance. She seldom wears anything else because she loves it’s subtle lite scent. Highly recommend this. Price here is super compared to department stores. ,5
48,I LOVE this perfume! It was too expensive in the mall. Luckily I looked here and it was 50% off. I get so many complements on it. I am in love!!!,5
48,"I absolutely love the fragrance. It's light, sexy, but not overpowering. It get you noticed with just enough scent with making people sneeze. It's charming and makes me feel beautiful. I use to save it for special occasions but now everyday is special so I wear it daily. It's my scent. The price to fantastic which makes it even more desirable. Thanks!",5
48,Marc Jacobs Daisy arrived on time and it the tester packaging because it is for my personal use... loved the value !!! It smelled so nice. Will recommend to anyone as it is legit!,5
49,Love it ,5
49,"This is the first time I've tried Vera Wang perfume and I love it! A girly, flirty scent that makes me feel desirable.",5
49,I have used this perfume before and everyone loved it. So I will order this from this site. It is refreshing and smells really good. A man told me he loved it on me and asked what I was wearing. He said he will get it for his wife,5
49,Vera Wang is my favorite perfume ever!!!!! I always have trouble finding it and I've never paid this low of a price for it!!!! I just grab the bottle and smell it every chance I get. Thank you I will always be a loyal customer. ,5

50,"Great buy, nice fragrance. Will buy another one",5
50,I’m so happy to hear all these rave reviews ,5
50,"I’ve loved Calvin Klein Escape perfume for years. I’ve tried other perfumes, but always come back to “Escape”. It is a chemistry thing and so far no other perfume smells as nice as “Escape”. ",5
50,"I love the smell, off Escape. It not overpowering. ",4
50,I’m glad I purchased “Escape eau by Calvin Klein” it smells really good and the smell last all day. Once the bottle is finished I would be buying another one. ,5
51," Design parfum by Paul Sabastion is the only perfume I do not have an alergy to. I have worn this and only this perfume for so many years I cannot even remember when I started using it!!! Always get lots of compliments on it......When I buy it online, I buy it in bulk because I save alot by doing so. Thank you PS...........please do not ever stop making it!!!!!! LynnLynn",5
51,"I've been using Design for 15 years & I instantly hooked. I get latest 5 compliments a day I always have a bottle of this, Versace yellow diamonds, Coco channel & Carolina Herrea",5
51,I have been using Paul Sebastian Design Perfume for over 20 years. I get compliments every day even in an office setting. I can't tell you how many men have asked me what I am wearing so they can buy it for their wife or girlfriend. I wear nothing else as a perfume.,5
51,My favorite fragrance by far. So many compliments on Design! Love it. ,5
51,"I started using it 20 years ago because of the scent , all other perfume would give me headache. Every where I go people ask me what perfume I’m wearing. It’s getting hard to fine so when I do fine it I’ll buy 2 to 3 bottles . Love it ",5
52,Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker; warms my sinuses with a subtle flowery bouquet of aroma. Not too loud or invasive. it's great for any occasion.,5
52,Thoughts I would try this one given the reviews. I usually we are Tresor by Lancome. Lovely has a sweeter smell in comparison but not extremely strong. A good casual fragrance for when you want to save your good stuff!,4
52,"I have used ""Lovely"" for many years, people would stop me, to ask me what I had on, they said it was so nice like I just walked out of the shower...so I use it during the day and at work. Love it!",5
52,I love this perfume it smells so nice,5
52,I enjoy this fragrance so much! It is light and airy.,5
53,Hugo by Hugo Boss smells great and lasts a long time. A couple sprays last me all day at work and I feel natrual wearing it. I build planes for a living so I'm not sitting behind a desk all day. I turn wrenches. I don't look for complements with this but smell like a confident man and I need that at work.,4
53,"this has been one of my favorite cologne's for quite a while. It has a refreshing, clean fragrance. love this product. ",5
53,This smells good. It's not overpowering.,5
53,Hugo Boss is a classic smell. Men and women love it. Very energetic smell that is suitable all year round.,5
53,Got a great price on a large volume of cologne. Price was great and shipping was easy and on time.,4
54, Versace Crystal Noir was a disappointment. I did not like the fragrance. I should have tried it at some department store before buying. ,3
54,Versace Crystal Noir. As expected from a Versace perfume it is a strong scent. The strength is still balanced so it's not out of hand. It is a mature and sophisticated scent suitable for classy diner parties. There is a pleasant sweet floral scent along with the overall strong perfume. The stronger notes fade faster than the sweeter ones so after awhile it becomes more of a lighter scent with a slight stronger touch instead of the other way around when it's first applied which still smells good just in a different way. The mini bottle has a plastic stopper in the large wide cap which makes it easy to grasp and the bottle itself is stout so it is easy to place down on a surface.,5
54,"Versace Crystal Noir by Gianni Versace Light, Genuine, not to floral just right. Hits the right notes and makes you feel good",5
54,"This is my all time favorite, hands down! Every time I wear this perfume I am asked by total strangers, ""what are you wearing?"". I never have that happen with any of my other perfumes. .that's say a lot.",5
54,I ordered Versace Crystal Noir. It was package well. Got what I expected. ,5
55,Nice smelling but not for everyone. I won’t purchase this in a bigger size. Glad I got the mini. It’s more “loud” to me. Not a fan of those much.,3
55,"Purchased a smaller bottle last month for my husband, and my son liked it so much till his dad gave it to him. He stated that every time he wears it he gets so many compliments. Had to purchase another one for my husband, but this time purchased the bigger bottle. ",5
55,why oh why did i buy this fragrance? I watched a lot of youtube reviews on Invictus and they all had good things to say about it. I pretty much knew what I was getting because several reviews noted that Invictus smelled like bubblegum. And they were absolutely right. This thing really really does smell like bubblegum......and i absolutely hate it. However that is my own fault for buying this because 1) i bought it blind 2) i saw reviews saying it smelled like bubblegum yet bought it anyway knowing damn well i don't want to smell like bubblegum. I give it 3 stars because it doesn't smell bad. It's just i don't want to smell like it.,3
55,Smells great all the people love it,5
55,"Great deal and I get compliments every single time I wear this , its worth the money #teddiout ",5
56,Got this Dolce&Gabbana for my son to try and likes it he said he would buy it.,4
56,I introduced this cologne to my dad years ago and he was blown away. He never wore colognes because my mom didn't like them but when he smelled this one he didn't care if she liked it or not. Eventually my mom started appreciating the unique fragrance Dolce & Gabbana had created and she never complained when he wore it. It's still my favorite cologne for men. It will forever be a classic!,5
56,DOLCE & GABBANA HE LOVES IT. WILL PURCHASE LARGE SIZE,5
56,"Excellent cologne, I love it! ",5
56,This was a great purchase! The tester was a full bottle that was never spayed. ,5
57,I love this website they have the best prices and quality perfect every time and I have ordered at least 15 different perfumes from them. They also send samples and coupons. They never disappoint .Shipping is also very quick.,5
57,"Yeah,,,, I Received a Sample too of this ( Exceptional-Because You Are ).... from my last order and........Pretty Nice Smell,,, Nice Projection and Long Lasting by now !!! It will be in my Wish List for Sure !! ",4
57,Exceptional- ….Works for me!,5
57,My husband loves the Exceptional cologne. He wears it a lot & gets a lot of compliments on the fragrance. ,5
57,Received this sample with my order and I had to buy it right away as soon as I smelled I pulled out my app and bought with no hesitation long last and one of my top 10 favorites u will not be disappointed I promise you ,5
58,Very very smell good. Love it.,5
58,"L'eau D'issey, it smells like HEAVEN!!!. It's soft and angelic, this has now become my FAVORITE!. I have gotten so many compliments, on this fragrance. My son wears the men's, and that's wat prompted me to try the ladies version. It last a pretty good while on you as well. I RECCOMEND this breath taking fragrance to anyone, you won't regret it!",5
58,"L'Eau d'Issey is the perfect fresh, feminine fragrance that will not dissapoint . I especially love how it smells clean and fresh even in hot , humid Florida days. Makes me feel pretty when I wear it , and I love to share the secret with other fragrance fanatics when I am asked"" what are you wearing?"" Lol !!! ",5
58,"I have been wearing L’Eau D’Issey since the late 90s. Someone sitting near me was wearing it and I asked her what it was. It is my “special scent” because when I first started wearing it and for many years, I was wearing the “eau de parfum” and it was not cheap. I bought the “Eau De Toilette” on a cruise and am just about to start using it. In retrospect, I think I was ripped off, but it is what it is. Anyway, when I wore it several years ago at a party, at least 5 or 6 men asked me what I was wearing because they wanted to buy it for their girlfriends or wives. I have also had women ask me about it, as well as my dentist several years ago. I have always loved this scent, one of my all-time favorites. ",5
58,"L'eau d'Issey is such a delightful light fragrance. It reminds you how fragrant our spring/summer months are! I enjoy the scent as I move through busy days, enjoying its delicious lightness.",5
59,I ordered the Acqua do Giovanni and I absolutely love it! It’s my favorite fragrance. I’m glad to know a site that has reasonable prices for my favorite scent! ,5
59,"A unique fragrance - very clean and fresh. Being a stronger fragrance, I use it very sparingly. I also like that it lasts all day! ",5
59,"I first received Acqua di Gioia as a gift and fell in love with it. When I saw in on FragranceNet at such an awesome price, I had to but it. When it arrived and I opened it, I fell in love with it all over again. Very light and aromatic.",5
59,Acquis di Gioia.....super fast delivery. Perfect condition....very very good price. Total satisfy,5
59,Acqua Di Gioia: fresh scent and have received compliments on the perfume. Lasts through the day as well. ,5
60,Eternity Aqua is very sexy smelling. Light and not overwhelming. Just a well blended frangrance thats smooth crisp and very inviting. I can most guaranty you will get compliments! It smells amazing. It last about 7 to 8 hours on me. That's pretty good!!! I just reapply if needed. I feel it works best for the warmer months but of course you can wear it all year round. So never think twice about purchasing this cologne. You will be glad you did! Trust me!,5
60,Awesome gift. I plan on buying the bigger bottle. ,4
60,"My Grandson requested Nautica Cologne for a Christmas gift and indicated that it was light blue. I got the Nautica Classic. He later indicated that he was referring to Nautica Blue. I reorder the Nautica Blue and gave him both. Needless to say he loves them both, and so do I.",5
60,Eternity Aqua is my son-in-law's favorite fragrance. He loves it very much. It was my Christmas gift to him and he was especially happy over it.,5
60,"My husband has been an Eternity user for quite some time. Happily, when Eternity Aqua was introduced he tried it and loved it! It's not overwhelming like the original Eternity! Thanks! ",5
61,"Black Opium, I love it.",5
61,Exactly what I wanted. ,5
61,Black Opium is a long lasting scent that is very quiet and sexy,5
61,Love the smell of Black Opium! Purchased my second bottle ,5
61,I love this! My Daughter got it for me originally and I have purchased it twice since then. Black Opium has become my signature fragrance.,5
62,Polo Red Is the real deal! I love a man in Polo Red. And authentic fragrance that is sexy clean and smooth.,5
62," Within 2 hrs people couldn't smell it unless they were basically hugging me. Good scent, but below average scent projection after the 2 hr mark..",5
62,Great smelling colonge was very happy with purchase ,4
62,I found the Polo red is very smooth smelling and sexy cologne,5
62,My husband loves it! The price is great!!,5
63,Simply Belle has a fresh clean soapy scent. I get many complements on it. I use it mostly during the day.,5
63,Love this Simply Belle - but disappointed they stopped carrying the little purse size one - it was perfect for on the go refreshing your scent. The scent is very strong so you only need a tiny spray that lasts a long time. ,3
63,I've been looking for this fragrance forever.. finally found and love it! Simply Belle!!,5
63,I have been using Simply Belle for quite a while . It smells great to me and I can only smell it whenever I first spray it on me. I thought it was just not lasting but I started to notice that a lot of people would tell me that I smell good and they ask me what I was wearing . I know that I love the smell of it myself .,5
63,"I love the scent of Simply Belle, It's light musky smell stays with you all day. It does have a fresh clean after shower feel scent. I've been buying several bottles after my first order! I love it! People also ask me ''What is that scent you're wearing too""",5
64,"Terre d'Hermes is this fragrance to say: ""I am here"" very bold, got a really nice presence. very masculine, one of my favorites.",5
64,Really like this 2 thumbs up,5
64,"Terre D’Hermes is one of the best men’s fragrances I’ve ever smelled. People say stuff like this ALL THE TIME in reviews, but I’m honestly kind of a fragrance snob and I’ve smelled and owned many, many scents. Currently this is in my top five favorites. For a scent to become my favorite, it has to have serious depth, complexity, and class, and this one has them all. It’s exquisitely earthy, but opens up with a blast of fresh orange. Its got hints of stone, wood, earth, and while that may not sound great to hear, trust me, it’s absolutely incredible and versatile, fresh and clean yet deep, woody and complex. ",5
64,Awesome very great service and product,5
64,"I am very pleased with Terre d'Hermes. A female colleague suggested the fragrance to me. I quickly sampled it and agreed. I am not one of these sophisticated guys who can describe essential elements of a fragrance, but I know what I like, and this fragrance has the elegance and warmth I Like. ",5
65,The only perfume I have ever wanted to wear.,5
65,I love Oscar and have worn it for years. I have had people ask me what I have on that smells so good. My husband loves the fragrance and saw it sitting on my dresser on our first date. He told me later-he thought to himself-don’t tell me she wears Oscar. He was thrilled. We got married less than a year and a half later. Oscar is an awesome fragrance and I love it!,5
65,"My nights on the town and dinner dates are long gone, but sandalwood seems to call to me. With jasmine and lavender, it was a no brainer for me. I wore this fragrance years ago and it brought back memories when I saw it listed. I haven't opened it yet, but I know I won't be disappointed when I do. It might even trigger some grand remembrances. (Smile)",4
65,"Oscar by Oscar De La Renta is a sexy, subtle and clean scent. Complete strangers stop me in the grocery store and in restaurants to tell me how delicious I smell! I have been wearing it since 1991. I've also had strangers follow me around to ask what perfume I had on. To find it here at such a discounted price is incredible. All my perfumes are on this site! Thank you for providing quality perfume at discounted prices. Sincerely, Sandra Souza",5
65,"my wife loves it, she had use Oscar de la Renta for many years.",5
66,"Some fragrances create a sensual comfort zone for me. Very few contain this quality for a man that lingers and presents a real sense of what I feel as a man. Every woman who has smelled this fragrance on my body has commented on it, and the response is also sensual and complimentary. For me, a daily fragrance, one worn month in, month out over years must exemplify my idea of who I am as a man. This fragrance does that. I am comfortable, stimulated, and feel its potency. I have used this fragrance for years now and highly recommend it.",5
66,"I like it, slightly smokey opener but dries down to a slightly sweet smell. Not overbearing and doesn't give that headache vibe or anything but you also don't become nose-blind to it later. Fall/Winter for me. Considering getting the EDP version for a little more projection.",5
66,The Doice & Gabbana is very good cologone this is my 2bd bottle. 5 stars. The ne,5
66,It was great got the rite name the one ,5
66,Omg this fragrance is awesome I love it !!,5
67,I bought this cologne for my husband. He really likes it and I love it too. This one is one of my favorite for my husband :). It is Black by Kenneth Cole ,5
67,Love the D&C light blue ,5
67,"Short story, some ten years back I traveled to Florida for vacation and stopped in a Kenneth Cole outlet store. Once inside I sampled the Kenneth Cole Black tester, then immediately fell in love with the scent. I decided to purchase the Kenneth Cole Black gift set. Who would have thought Kenneth Cole Black would end up being my favorite go-to cologne still to this day. If ""Gorgeous"" had a scent, Kenneth Cole Black would absolutely be it. It's sexy and very classy. Thanks so much FragranceNet for making KC Black just that much easier to aquire.",5
67,Kenneth Cole Black Very Nice. The ladies like it and that makes me like it!! Great buy ! ,5
67,No substitute for Kenneth Cole -Black. ,5
68,Karl Laugerfeld cologne original I have used this exclusively for almost 40 years or since it came out. I will never use anything else - so many ladies have asked me what is that fabulous cologne you are wearing. ,5
68,I love that produc (Lagerfeld Cologne) I been using that Cologne for many many years. ,5
68,Always a favorite. The musky aroma is perfect mixed with various spices. Light enough to also use as astringent aftershave.. The price also fits my budget.,4
68,This Karl Lagerfeld EDT is no the same scent as in the mid 80’s to mid 90’s when I used it. Either that or my scent smell has changed. I was hoping it would be the same hopefully I can give a away the three bottles purchased.,1
68,My husband loves Lagerfeld .. so when you guys get stock we buy up big . Fantastic value for money . Prompt shipping to Australia .. thanks Fragrance Net .. ,5
69,"This is a great everyday scent. Great comments from strangers ""you smell nice"".",4
69,"Love this fragrance, Burberry brit ,bought since it came out. Lots of compliments all the time. Unfortunately, they changed packaging and I am not sure if it the same fragrance. Thats why i bought a tester. Its for me, so i don't mind. Will buy few more",5
69,Love this scent.....so me!,5
69,"I bought Burberry Brit on a Korean Air flight when the flight attendant told me it is the perfume they all wear. It smelled like a bouquet of flowers on her. It smells like a urinal cake on me. I thought there was something wrong with the bottle. My Korean daughter tried it, and she also smelled like a bouquet. Guess it has to do with body chemistry.",1
69,You know you are a Burberry girl it's a warm fresh scent and smells like you are wrapped in vanilla cream.,5
70,It comes in very strong so don't burn your nose on it. After the dry down its amazing stuff! Don't think about it. Just buy it.,4
70,"Club de nuit intenso...increible, al principio de usarla no sentía ningún resultado, pero al paso del tiempo fue una bomba ,coma a la semana de usarla donde quiera que iba recibía elogios y muchas mujeres me preguntaban que fragancia estaba usando...la recomiendo.",5
70,"Club de nuit intenso...increible, al principio de usarla no sentía ningún resultado, pero al paso del tiempo fue una bomba ,coma a la semana de usarla donde quiera que iba recibía elogios y muchas mujeres me preguntaban que fragancia estaba usando...la recomiendo.",5
70,"Armaf Club de nuit!!!! This is a bargain for the price! This is at 90% close to Aventus, if not the cheapest Aventus on the market. People been asking me what is this and it’s performing so well, and for hours. If you know where to spray it on your skin, then you are sure to make people head turn and follow your sillage for the scent and the smells stick to your skin for 24h. Well!!! sometimes costs ain’t defining the performances.",5
70,"I am yet to smell Aventus Creed, but this product is a marvel in its own way.... well done Armaf.",5
71,I was disappointed with the product because the fragrance does last more than an hour or two. ,1
71,"The product was great, except it was sent with no lid. It makes it very hard to travel with.",4

72,"Profumo is a great cologne! Fresh, earthy, masculine smell ",5
72,"This is a very good fragrance, I having been wearing it for over 3 years. I prefer the larger 6.2 ounce bottle but it is very hard to get. I wish they would offer the 6.2 oz bottle.",5
72,"Acqua Di Gil always makes me happy, but this Profumo is a beast. I recommend it to all men who love themselves. I even need a bigger size lol",5
72,"This is a classic..... Acqua Di Gio Profumo..... One of the better fragrance I have used, the smell is long lasting and compliments are many..... Definately one for your collection",5
72,When I first put this on I thought it was just like the original. But after a couple hours it becomes something so much better. I highly recommend this fragrance. ,5

73,I wore this when it was first introduced in 1988. I thought they stopped making it. I’m glad I found it again. The scent is beautiful and stays with you. ,5

75,I think it smells great. Just be careful not to use to much and you’ll be good to go. I would purchase again. ,5
75,"Recently purchased La Nuit de L'homme and I must say it was underwhelming. My signature scent is Dior Sauvage and whenever I enter a room or a building my presence is registered before I'm even seen. So I bought this YSL cologne to give it a try, and ever since using it, I've had zero compliments :(. I'm going back to Sauvage, and I'm giving away my YSL to someone who may appreciate it better.",2
75,The success of the cologne La Nuit de l’Homme I measure by the number of ladies who comment upon it when I wear it in their presence. A typical comment would be “You always smell so nice”. It is a pleasant but unusual scent that lasts well on the body.,5
75,"YSL La Nuit de L'Homme EDT Now I understand all the hype and complimentary comments. Simply put, one of THE best men's fragrances of all time. Enough said. ",5

77,"“CK BE” is my uncle’s favorite cologne. Opening the bottle to smell the product before giving it to him-I could tell it was his signature scent. Manufacturing numbers did match up on both bottle & box, as well as in an actual online database; so that if you’re skeptical about this website-don’t be. They function on what is known as a ‘gray market’!",5
77,"I WAS SURE GLAD TO FIND THIS WEBSITE SO I NEVER HAVE TO RUN OUT OF CK Be. I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND I JUST LOVE IT. THANK YOU, WILLIAM ",5
78,The Cashmere Mist eau de parfum does not seem to have the same scent or lasting effect it used to have. I used to get comments about how wonderful it smelled; I don't get them anymore. I wonder if something was changed in the formula.,2

82,Polo Black is my favorite scent on my husband! He always gets compliments and people wanting to know what it is! Your prices are fantastic! Will buy again and have recommended your site to several friends! ,5
83,"A nice, somewhat generic fragrance with poor performance. It lingers close to the skin with no sillage; this seems to be a trend for Mont Blanc fragrances, at least in my experience. I won't be repurchasing this one.",3
83,"pink pepper is to feminine , the legend is much better ",2
83,"I absolutely Love Mont Blanc Legend Spirit, this is my 5th bottle. It’s just a very pleasant and no offensive Fragrance that I basically use as a “gym scent”, though it’s great for the office as well. It’s one of my fragrances for life! Gets me ready to do a great workout.",5

84,"Gucci Bamboo EDP would be the perfect fragrance for me if not for the urine smelling lily and neroli/orange blossom combination. It smells great on first spray and I almost bought a bottle off of that initial spray, but when it settled, it smelled horrible on my skin. If you like strong lily and/or neroli/orange blossom then you'll like this, but for me it's a no-go.",1
84,Hummmmm Gucci bamboo it’s my first wonderful not to strong just right will recommend it to anyone ,5

108,I have worn Mackie for so long I can't recall when I started wearing it. I'm always complimented when I wear it.,5
108,Mackie was my chosen scent in the 1990s used to pay almost $100 a bottle. So happy to see fragrance net still offers it for a very cheap price. The scent is a perfect soft smell not overpowering and I get many compliments. ,5
108,"Love, love, love my Mackie. It is defiantly my best friend. I wear it every day. I have never tried the lotion, but will order it today. I'm so thankful that I found you, and just hope and pray you will continue to be able to supply me for a long time. ",5
108,The smell is a very nice professional smell. The kind of smell you would want to wear if you worked in an office setting. ,5
108,"Mackie by Bob Mackie has been my ""go to"" scent for an everyday use whether at work or at home for many years! Fresh scent, never overpowering if you have the right pigments to wear it. Paired with the Body Lotion, you will feel fresh all day long . It has been my signature smell for many years and I wear it winter and summer, day or night. Some people told me that even ""blindfolded"" they would know it's me...it's MY smell! Love it!!!",5
109,"My mom loves Navy perfume. Navy perfume is hard to find, so I purchased it for my mom. ",5
109," I was given a sample of Navy by a co-worker a couple of months ago, and skeptical, because I love what I love. Don't like trying or using other perfumes..once I tried it, I love this Navy perfume. Very feminine and subtle scent.",5
109,I have worn and loved Navy since the 1970s. It's a wonderful scent and I'm happy to have another sample for my collection,5
109,"I haven't used Navy in at least 20 years, but I loved it in the 90s, and love it still. My only disappointment is that it isn't in a spray bottle. I hope it will be the next time I order it.",4
109,Navy cologne. Nice scent. Quite feminine. Bought the tiny size to try it first before purchasing full size. I like the scent. Very mild and it overpowering. ,5
110,I personally love it .it fragrance is calming .,5
110,"I purchased Glow and it smells awful, it smells like bug spray. It probably would work for an older person.",1
110,I dont mind this parfum jo glow. Not my normal scent but it's ok.,3
110,"I’ve been using Glow by JLo for about 15 years. It’s my go to perfume. I’ve gotten so many compliments on it, been stopped in stores and even on elevators more than once with “you smell so nice, what’re you wearing?” Smells light, fresh and clean! ",5
110,"GLOW by JLO I always love to purchase perfume, but this one I didn't really appreciate the scent or smell. ",2
111,Grey Flannel My husband's only cologne. Love it. Was disappointed it wasn't a spray. Didn't notice when ordering. ,5
111,"Grey Flannel is a classic fragrance I like to use a lot in the fall and winter. Great smell not over powering, light, and refreshing. I will buy over and over again.",5
111,I ALWAYS LIKE THIS PERFUME,5
111,"I BOUGHT IT FOR MY SON, BUT I ALWAYS LIKE THIS PERFUME SMELL SO GOOD , I USED TO BUY IT FOR MY EX HUSBAND, I JUST LOVE THE SMELL, AND I LIKE STRONG PERFUMES THAT IS THE REASON THAT I ORDER AND AN SMALL ONE FOR ME",5
111,Wonderful smelling cologne for Men.,5
112,"I have not met one person who was NOT mesmerized by this fragrance! I absolutely love it! It also makes men draw nearer to me, which is an added bonus!",5
112,"Whenever I wear Perry Ellis 360, people will stop and ask what I'm wearing. It's such a fresh, clean scent and I love it!",5
112,"I first smelled this about 2 years ago when a friend walked by me at a picnic and I absolutely loved how it smelled, so clean and fresh. She went home and brought me the bottle to show me exactly what it was. A few weeks later I bought myself a bottle, and I paid more for a smaller bottle than I did on this site. The bottles arrived on time and smell exactly like the bottle I bought in a store. The other day while out shopping I was entering a store when another lady was exiting, after she passed me she turned and said ""Oh my God you smell so good"". It has become my favorite scent. ",5
112,A friend of mine left me try this I love it my new favorite ,5
112,"This is one of my Favorite ( Perry Ellis 360 ) . It is summer in a bottle, fresh, clean . I have been wearing Perry Ellis 360 for over 25 years and each time I wear it people follow me asking what is that you are wearing, or, you smell divine !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love, love, love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Daisy P. ",5
113,Smells clean and goes with anything and occasion. Works very well with my body chemistry. I always get compliments when I wear it. ,5
113,I love my order Tommy Girl . Thank you. ,5
113,"Love it, love it!!! It is worth the purchase ",5
113,Tommy Girl has been my favorite for years. It is so clean smelling. And fresh. Not a lot of floral scents. Just fresh!!,5
113,I love this perfume!!!! TommyGirl!!! I used to wear this but couldn’t find it anywhere!!! Now i no where I can find it!!! From u guys!!! Thank you,5
114,"Great cologne, I'm not one to go for strong sents that you can smell from 20 feet away. Boss #6 is great for people like me who like a more suttle sent.",5
114,"To be a BOSS, you must wear HUGO BOSS! Ladies love it, and It loves their attention.",5
114,"Hugo Boss' Boss #6 is my husbands favorite since many years back, I guess since 2000 and I love it too! It's fresh yet classic so it can be worn each day at work but also for more special occasions.",5
114, The light smell does not last very long....all day,3
114,"Hugo Boss is still my favorite fragrance, thanks for the excellent service!!!",5
115,"I’ve been trying like crazy to find a bottle of this wonderful fragrance for my wife but sadly no matter where I buy from, none have any staying power like the original from the 80s had. After spending close to $200 in multiple attempts, it’s time to throw in the towel and give up on finding this from anywhere. I had high hopes ordering from here but it’s just another disappointment and confirms I should give up trying to find. Sad.",1
115, GIORGIO forWomen EDT SPRAY 3 oz. The pk arrived securely packaged & padded in a timely manner. This is the first time I have ordered from this co. and didn’t know what to expect! I am well satisfied and will order again and will tell my friends at work. The package also came with a free nail clipper and several nice samples of other scents I might want to check out. I also ordered: RED for Women EDT SPRAY 3 oz. AND RED for Women BODY LOTION 1.6 oz. All were “by Giorgio Beverly Hills”. Didn’t feel like writing three separate Reviews when I was going to say the same thing! Very Happy with them all. ,5
115,"I’m not sure what the problem is with this product, but it has an awful aroma. The rest of my order is just fine but the Giorgioi is an overpowering scent of something else!",1
115,I just love this fragrance. It’s not heavy or overwhelming. I’m sorry that Giorgio is no longer sold in department stores ,5
115,"I have used so many perfumes from cheap ones to very expensive. I always circle back to Giorgio. There is nothing like it. I always get compliments when I wear this more than anything else. More than Creed, Jimmy Choo, Estes Lauder etc. Maybe it’s just perfect for my body chemistry and it gives me an ego boost...I feel so sexy wearing it",5
116,"I 1st heard of ""The Dreamer"" back in '98 while watching a music video by a group called ""Philly's Most Wanted"". They tell these women the scent of The Dreamer is all they're getting. Just happened to be in Macy's 1 day, saw it and bought it. Till this day I'm still wearing it and get'n compliments. Thanks for making such a wonderful fragrance and continuing keeping it available!",5
116,Love this cologne! it has such a unique smell. ,5
116,I love this Fragrance ,5
116,I first purchased Dreamer for my two youngest grandsonsl (16 and18 years old) two years ago. They loved it. They have requested it on their birthday and Christmas every year since then. It is the best smelling men's cologne. The sent is mild but sexy. ,5
116,"Really love my Dreamer, the only one I use",5
117, I love Mont Blanc Legend Night this is one of my favorite cologne. Plus it last all day,5
117,"Mont Blanc Legend Night is a scent all men should have in their cologne arsenal. Warm citrus and wood undertones. Scents blends well into the skin. Long lasting, but not overpowering. This scent can range from casual to formal. The scent brings great compliments those around me. You could spend 10 times more money and still not have as arousing or as stimulating a scent. ",5
117,"GREAT SCENT receive many compliments , perfume lasts longer",5
117,"Mont Blanc Legend Night has a pleasant scent. However, after smelling Dior Hypnotic Poison, this will start to smell like a generic version of Dior's. Otherwise, not bad.",3
117,Great scent! This is most definitely an under rated brand in my opinion! Every time I wear it I always get complimented and asked “what are you wearing”. Ofcourse I never tell them can’t let the secret out to everyone.,5
118,This smells so amazing!,5
118,"LOVE Burberry Body! My first bottle was bought by my husband and I have wore it ever since, love it! Perfume smells different on each person but I always get compliments when I wear this.",5
118,Burberry Body is a lovely everyday scent and perfect for work. This will be one of my summer scents. Very happy with my purchase!,5
118,One if my new favorites! Will definitely keep this in stock! Get compliments on it and I just love how the scent lingers on. ,4
118,"Burberry Body eau de parfum is my signature, 'go to' scent!! I absolutely love this fragrance!! It smells so fresh & clean and reminds me of a warm, spring day! The scent lasts all day and I can still smell it on me even after I shower! I have received several compliments when I wear this ! I have the 2.8 ounce bottle and have used it so much that I am going to need to buy another one very soon so that I'm stocked up for when the weather gets warmer!! Thank you so very much FragranceNet, for carrying this fragrance and offering it at a great price!! ",5
119,Buy the jaguar black for my husband he love it,5
119,I was very skeptical of this brand Jaguar black classic I love it now I will continue on purchasing Jaguar cologne for men,5
119,"Jaguar black.. bought a while ago, & have received compliments when I have worn it from the ladies. For the price it was worth the gamble. ",4
119,"Love it..First time purchasing a Jaguar cologne, and for the price I'm very impressed. ",5
119,"Love it..First time purchasing a Jaguar cologne, and for the price I'm very impressed. ",5
120,"I absolutely love Good Girl! I do wish that it lasted longer, I usually take it with me so I can refresh throughout my day ",5
120,I ordered Good Girl and got it within 7 days. Buying it here was cheaper than me buying it at my work where I get 20% off purchases so I was really excited to see the quality of the perfume - I was not disappointed. It smells amazing and has become my favourite perfume ,5
120,Good Girl is an attention grabber. This is a beautiful scent that carries and last for hours. This scent is not for the timid shy girl. It's for the woman who is a all around bad ass boss bihh,5
120,Good Girl is an attention grabber. This is a beautiful scent that carries and last for hours. This scent is not for the timid shy girl. It's for the woman who a all around bad ass,5
120,The black opium. Just wasn't right. You can't smell it. I had a sample of of Nordstrom's the scent last the entire day. I purchased the bottle from the website and to me was a waste of money after a half hour of wearing it you can't smell it I've even asked people do they smell it and there response is no. The CH GOOD GIRL is ok.,2
121,Nearly all perfumes regardless of brand or cost trigger migraines for me even worn by other people. There is something very different about Ciara. It is the only fragrance I have found that does not cause migraine. I wore the 200 strength for years but is no longer manufactured. Rare bottles when found are $200 or more. I would gladly pay it if I could. I've worn Ciara in one strength or another since 1979 and love it. I AM Ciara! ,5
121,This fragrance is a real gem. It certainly outshines any other fragrance in uniqueness and a bonus Ciara is a bargain. What more could you want. It's got monster sillage as well. Ciara has a subtle oriental vibe almost gourmand. Easily tolerated sandalwood. A forest feel without the green. Berry season comes to mind. Yeah. Ciara. ,5
121,I have been wearing this since high school. I get so many compliments when I wear it. This is my go to scent when I am wanting to be unique and different from everyone else around me. It lasts a long time and smells expensive. ,5
121,"I Love Ciara stays on all Day.....I’m going to buy 2 more bottles.,",5
121,CIARA 100% BY REVLON IS MY NEW SIGNATURE PERFUME. IT LASTS ALL DAY. LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS ON MY BODY CHEMISTRY. IT IS REASONABLY PRICED AND I PREFER IT OVER MANY MORE HIGHER PRICED PERFUMES.,5
122,Received in my first bottle and was not satisfied had a strong alcohol smell to it. I called and spoke with customer service and had no issues getting a replacement bottle. Once I received the new bottle I was very satisfied with the product I received it is a very nice clean smell by far one of my favorites,5
122,"Creed Green Irish Tweed. I like the smell. This perfume doesn't perform, so I did not get any compliments.",2
122,I'm a cologne enthusiast and Green Irish Tweed is one of the best out there period. Huge oil content so the scent lasts so long that often times you can still smell it on your skin even after taking a shower. Can't recommend this enough. ,5
122,"Green Irish Tweed by CREED literally smells as if I'm walking along the western Irish coast looking over the cliffs of Moher. It's a gorgeous scent that works for night as well as day. Clean, with a touch of warmth that flows with you all day. It's a bit pricey, but b/c it's an Eau de Parfum it lasts at least 8 hours on your skin. Well worth the price alone. Just a few dabs on your body heat points and you are good to go.",5
122,"Creed Irish Tweed is a beautiful cent. I wasn't sure about the opening but when it dried down, wow! To say the least, it's amazing. ",5
123,Great Price. Absolutely love it! Shipping got here very fast also.. thank you ,5
123,Long time favourite. Subtle but noticeable. ,5
123,Tresor is my all time favorite I wear it and always get told you smell so good. just love it and the price is great. Thank you karola Runyan,5
123,"Lancome Tresor has long been one of my favorite perfumes. It mixes with my body chemistry beautifully and I always get many compliments when wearing it,~ and thanks to the many sales and special discounts it is affordable.",5
123,"Tre`sor my very favor, I usually get it at Macys with the body powder,Body cream and to go spray and small hand cream. it runs 279.00 at Christmas!!!",5
124,My #1 fragrance ( Amarige Givenchy!! I’ve been using this for over 20 years and the scent remains the same. Love love love it ,5
124,"This is one of my favorites, and I hope it's always available.",5
124,Love this scent!!! Lots of compliments!!!,5
124,"In 1999, a coworker introduced me to Amarige by Givenchy because she had received a sample of it at the department store and didn't care for it. She offered the sample to me and it is among my most favorite scents. I instantly loved it and received many compliments at work and it lasts all day. Shortly after falling in love with Amarige, I purchased the Amarige body butter and sometimes layer layer the perfume with the butter. It's my signature scent. Never stop making this gem from Givenchy.",5
124,"Amarige by Givenchy is my signature fragrance! I LOVE, Love, love it! I started wearing it in the early 1990's. I kept it my secret for many years. I always get/got compliments on my fragrance.... especially from men who wants to purchase it for their girlfriends, wives, etc. My kids could always tell if I had been at school, ballgames etc. My friends and family call it Tese! (nickname short for terisa)",5
125, I first tried the 4711 cologne splash in 1967 In Curaçao as a cooling agent. Been using it ever since as an after shave. ,5
125,4711. Great after shower splash. Love it. ,5
125,Got this as a gift so I didn't try it. First time ordering from Fragrancenet and pleased with prices and delivery ,4
125,"Great smell. Sweet like candy, but smell doesn’t last past 30 minutes.",3
125,I love 4711! I've used it for years. It's nice and light and refreshing never heavy!!,5
126,I have been wearing Wings ever since it was introduced. It is a light floral perfume that everybody always comment on when I wear it. It is now hard to get. I used to get it from Hong Kong and I now have resorted to having it sent to Australia from the USA. Keep up the good work.,5
126,I was pleasantly surprised at the scent of Wings. I was looking for a light day time scent and this one fits the bill. It is light and fresh smelling. I still keep my Obsession handy but this is a good perfume for just everyday. Really like it! ,5
126,Love Wing and always did glade you carry it at such a good price. Hope you continue to sell it.,5
126,Wings.....how do I count the many ways I love this fragrance!! Have worn it for 25 plus years....never tire of it....get compliments every time I wear it........it was made for me!! Thank You for keeping it in stock.....I panic when I get half done with my present bottle......Continued blessings to all..............,5
126,"Wings by Giorgio Beverly Hills a true timely classic. I love it and people seems to really acknowledge the fragrance. I had always been told this perfume smells different on everyone. I guess, I had luck on my side. After all these years, Wings is my go to product!",5
127,I get so many compliments about this Euphoria for men. I initially used the body spray but now I have the cologne. I will definitely make this part of my rotation.,5
127,Not really my taste. Usually I like Calvin Klein no matter what but not happy on this one. It's weak and not my type of scent.,3
127,I have not got my order 2 orders of euphoria men’s cologne by Calvin Klein,1
127,This is perfect for travel! Adorable size of Euphoria!,5
127,"price very reasonable, pleasing smell, but thought the scent would last longer than it does.",4
128,"Aromatics Elixir is one of my very favorite frangrances. It has a lovely scent and it lasts a long time. I have missed this perfume because I wore it for years when it first came out and all of a sudden, I could not find it. Am so glad you have it!.",5
128,I have used the Aromatics Elixir by Clinique for years. I am 81 years old and get so excited when ladies and/or men ask me what perfume I am wearing. My daughter wore it before I started. I have tried different Brands of perfume but there is none that works for me.,5
128,"Aromatic Elixir!!!! My nephew is 35 and he say the smell reminds his of his childhood days with me! I just cove it. I get so many compliments when i wear it, ",5
128,Aromatics Elixir is my favorite perfume. I receive many compliments from men and women when I wear it. Love it!,5
128,Aromatics Elixir is my favorite perfume. I receive many compliments from men and women when I wear it. This size is perfect for my travel bag. Love it!!,5
129,"Dolce & Gabbana is great, really love it and your prices are great. Very satisfied with the 2.5 oz ""The One"" and the sample D&G box set that I bought .",5
129,"D&G The One for women, has so many great reviews that I was sure I would love it. Unfortunately, I don’t. It smells like a too sweet, warm floral to me. I don’t hate it, but I have too many more pleasing fragrances (Creed Royal Princess, Flowerbomb, Chanel No 5) to wear this. My husband and teenage daughter also gave it the thumbs down. What added to the disappointment is that I smelled The One for men, and instantly had to buy it for my husband. It is so sexy and yummy on him. Too bad The One for women just doesn’t do it for me.",3
129,Thank you very much for perfume. The One is the one of my favorite. I love it and I’ve got very fast....,5
129,A lady walked past me while I was shopping at a jewlery counter today. I approached her and asked what she was wearing as I loved the scent. She said D&G The One. So of course I shared that with my daughter who earlier in the day had asked what I wanted for my upcoming birthday. ,5
129,Light and exotic. A compliment magnet. Lasts all day.,5
130,This is such a light clean and fresh fragrance. It is perfect for work where you're stuck in the office around people. It is not offensive at all and best of all it is so inexpensive. I would recommend this to anyone. ,5
130,"I LOVE Fancy Love by J. S. Been wearing it now for about 4yrs. I've had more compliments on this from women than anything I've ever worn. Which I concider a plus bc most women don't compliment other women on fragrance like men do. Last all day. Its light and fresh, not over whelming. This is truly my fragance and FragranceNet is the best place to buy.",5
130,"I was so dissapointed with this scent. I am in love with Jessica Simpson's fragances except Fancy Love. To me, i just smells like a dull sweetness and makes me fill slightly ill. There is no ""crispness"" to it....nothing to counter all the flat sweetness. I almost feel like my nose is stuffy when I smell it....its very strange. It has so many good reviews i just cant believe I am smelling what everyone else dose almost. ",1
130,Jessica Simpson's Fancy love is my FAVORITE!! LOVE THIS PERFUME and the scent is so beautiful and lasts so long. ,5
130,Fancy Love by Jessica Simpson is my signature scent. I always get so many compliments on it. I’ve had people who were walking behind me tell me that I smell amazing! Thanks FragranceNet for having the best price for this perfume. ,5
131,"Boucheron eau de parfum by Boucheron, in my opinion, has a very nice, masculine scent, but is flawed by having a very short lifespan once it is applied. 2 hours after I put it on (liberally, I should add), I can't detect the scent any longer.",2
131,"I have been used a Boucheron Parfum since 1996, I like the smell and I continue to wear it.",5
131,"He love this Boucheron very much, I just wish I had order a gift set of it. ",5
131,"This is a great fragrance, citrus opening that is very fresh , but it is the drydown where this perfume really shines. Super sophisticated scent. Nothing quite like it. Recommended highly! ",5
131,"Just got my order for the same Boucheron Eau de parfum and it came sealed with the same blue box and the same gorgeous smell that I have come to love. It will last all day and becomes a powdery smell that to me is a mix of vetiver,musk and lavender. Such a rich smell! I have purchased Boucheron for many years and I always get compliments. I got my order in a week exactly what FragranceNet had told me. I am so happy with my purchase!!",5
132,Absolutely Love The Cologne!!! Highly Recommend CK One,5
132,Ck one Red Smells Great and drives my wife nuts and well worth the money I paid and it lasts thanks for the fast shipping and great prices and product.,5
132,It smell ok but to strong for my nose! I took a chance without going to the mall smelling it first....SMH,1
132,Really nice for the price,3
132,Omg it’s excellent and the right price ❤️,5
133,Drakkar Noir is a great smelling cologne. My husband wheres it everyday and he smells great. I would recommend Drakkar Noir for every man.,5

134, A Lovely smelling fragrance. It is unknown to many.,4
134,This fragrance is fresh and clean. Great for summertime wear.,5
134,This is by far the most amazing perfume! It is a part of my daily routine. I think the name should be etched onto the bottle. Please dont ever stop making it!!!,5

135,"Omg, the best fragrance when am wearing 212 men I smell rich compliment galore,,chucky",5

136,This is my all time fave! ,5
136,"I've been wearing this perfume for probably at least 10 yrs and I can't even tell you how many people have stopped me to ask what kind of perfume I'm wearing.

137,"Vera Wang is such a nice suttle feminine fragrance. Though the name may imply a younger fragrance, I find it nice for any age. I not only judge the staying power and smell of a fragrance but of coarse the compliments as well!",5
137,"I have been using PRINCESS by Vera Wang for 12 years ❤ I have trouble finding a scent I liked, until PRINCESS! It has a light fragrance which is what I want. People are Always asking what I am wearing!! And you get it at a Great Price!! Vickie Durbin August 15th. 2019",5

138,I have been using Aramis for over forty years. I receive comments all the time from people that recognize the aroma. I am one of those people that still like and use the pour-in. Unfortunately I have not been able to purchase the pour-in from your company.. HELP!!,5
138,"My son first wore Aramis when in his mid 20's, it was his favorite . Unable to find it for many years, now that I've found it on Fragrance Net, I'm going to surprise him with it on his 60th birthday next month.. I'll be as happy giving it as he'll be receiving it. It's the best !",5
138,Really like this cologne. Service was great,5
138,"Aramis ""Fortified"" was the reason, I swear, that my wife married me! Shame they don't make that version any longer. It was enough to send a college room filled with females to flock towards my location. The scent lasts, or did last in the fortified version, nearly 12 hours! Aramis is and will always be the scent I was born to wear! R3",5
138,Been wearing Aramis for years!!! It has always been fresh and reliable with a popular scent!! Can never go wrong with Aramis!!!!!!,5

139,My sister wears Casual and she smells so good. I have never tried it because I've worn Mackie since the 90's and my husband tells me how good I smell. ,4
139,I have been wearing Casual for 19 years. OMG -I am routinely complimented on this scent!,5

140,My daughter loves the wonderful sexy but soft scent. She wears it a lot and gets plenty of compliments on it.,5
141,Great fresh fruity fragrance great house of cologne,4
141,Smells good but just like Joop. Pretty much the same cologne kinda disappointed because I have joop obviously I would want a different scent. ,3
141,"This scent is definitely for the younger generation. It’s a very minty, soapy scent. I like it a lot, although the compliments on it have been limited. But for the price range, definitely a quality/safe buy! ",4
141,I love the smell it's a go to cologne ,5
141,"Mont Blanc “Individual” In my opinion, this is a Joop spinoff. With that being said, I also would say that it is an improvement to some extent. It’s more of a toned down sent that Joop and it has some other notes that gives it its own unique smell. Joop is a much stronger fragrance and some people don’t like it because of its power. Individual takes similar notes and delivers an everyday all around sent that can be admired and appreciated by the masses.",5
142,Miracle is the only perfume I have used that makes me smile each time I put it on ! It is light and makes me feel light and full of freedom when I wear it. !!! ,5
142,Miracle's is the lightest cent yet sticks with you all Day!,5
142,I have used Miracle for a long time and I love it. ,5
142,Lancome miracle is my perfume and I just love it. Smells great! Been using it for years and will continue to use it. ,5
142,"I LOVE MIRACLE by Lancôme. Miracle is the only fragrance I buy and have been using it year round for almost 25 years. I get compliments everywhere I go even from my granddaughters,10 and 7.",5
143,My favorite scent by far! Get compliments all the time when wearing it. Young or older can wear it...very clean and subtle fragrance that lasts for hours. This perfume is cheaper than others and highly recommend It! ,5
143,"Clinique Happy Heart is an amazing scent and I'm glad I found it for such a great price! It's a fresh, fruity, floral scent that has great staying power. Give it a try.",5
143,"One of my favorites! I love this fragrance, it smells beautiful.",5
143,"Happy heart,what a lovely scent. Great for anyone who is sensitive to strong fragrances. Even women 70+ can wear this with ease. No complaints on this one. Enjoy!! ",5
143,"I love the way Happy Heart smells. It actually made me happy... until my Granny asked for it, she said it smelled real purdy, it was her birthday what could I do, lol. But I will replace it...and hide it.",5
144,Love the light fresh scent always get compliments on the scent,5
144,"I am disappointed with D&C Light Blue Eau Intense. The scent does not last on me; after 30 to 50 minutes, it is gone. The Light Blue Regular might be a better choice for me.",3
144,I absolutely love Light Blue Eau Intense. And the price was great compared to Utla and other retailer. I've been wearing Light Blue for years.,5
144,I have worn D & G Light Blue for many years. Recently I bought Eau Intense--DO NOT LIKE IT AT ALL. Smells like straight chemicals. I am totally disappointed,1
144,I’ve worn Light Blue since it’s launch many years ago. It’s all I wear. I have LB Intense as well. Both favorites. I recently sprayed a bit on my husband and omg he smells great!! I think it can be unisex !!! I love it in both of us !!,5
145,"Elizabeth Arden ""Green Tea"" set on my shelf in the closet for months. I decided to spray a dab on myself again, to see if I needed to keep it or not. It was then that I fell in love with the scent. I have been wearing everyday since. Elizabeth Arden makes great fragrances, but they are very inexpensive. I wish all name brands were that way. But yes I highly recomend Green Tea. I plan to purchase another bottle very soon I am no fan of strong perfume smells, they tend to make me dizzy and nauseous, so believe me, this is not one of those scents that make me want to get away from it ",4
145,Someone gave me a bottle of this Green Tea as a gift. It was a small bottle and I have loved it ever since. My daughter gave me another bigger bottle last Christmas and the smell does not last as long. It there a difference in them or is the strength different. I do want another bottle. I love the fragrance very much. Just wondering how to order.,5
145,"I like Green Tea scent, i am wearing this for my everyday routine and I feel always fresh. I got a lots of compliments.",5
145,"Green Tea is such a mild clean smell. 1 of my favorite of many. Clinique in the Bloom, Armani code for women & Coach Love.",5
145,Beautiful smell last all night.,5
146,"WinnieD, Bond #9 The Scent of Peace is up there with Creed for which I do have in my arsenal as the top (2) fragrances I use daily! I must say wearing Bond#9 I get so many compliments regarding this fragrance...in fact it arrives before I get there...amazing! I luv them both!!!",5
146,Johnny Smith it is a nice smell very very well put,4
146,"The Scent of Peace. Really enjoyed this one. Not hard to like this one. For the price though, not sure it’s really worth all that. But it does smell pretty good.",4
146,"This cologne is now joke. In my own words a serious pantie dropper. I walked in a restaurant where the chicken smell is very strong. This cologne overpowered the smell of chicken so much that the girl behind the counter said, oh my God someone smells so good!!!",5
146,Bond 9 Scent of Peace- I was disappointed in this one too along with the Bond 9 New York Oud. All the hype I read and studied but no internet doesn’t make the cut. People say they smell pineapple with musk.,1
147,Bloom is a great smell. Everyone says they can smell me a mile away. And it’s an all long lasting smell I get compliments every time I wear it. I love it ,5
147,"Gucci bloom is an old lady smell I was so disappointed in this one. I thought it would have a rose smell but it literally smells like my grandma’s house. No for the young, even my 22 year old daughter thought it stunk. ",1
147,"Love it,smells so pretty. I wanted something for summer and this is it!",5
147,Gucci Bloom is wonderful. So fresh and clean!,5
147,Great perfume like the fragrance ,5
148,"I've never before purchased a cologne that I hadn't previously actually smelled (kind of stupid I know), but I was recommended it by a friend (not even a trusted friend at that, so very stupid) and liked the descriptions that I read on line. It was actually exactly what I was hoping for! A new scent for the summer that's not to strong or masculine, but also not too sweet and perfume-like. Givenchy Pi and Paco Rabbane 1 Million Lucky are now my two favorites! ",5
148,"Pi is the Mystery, people always telling me how nice I smell . seriously I get both unpleasant and beautiful women asking me what cologne I wear, I simply tell them its my natural me...……… they laugh and walk away but hey I got there attention . Phil ",5
148,Wonderful cologne second time purchasing.,5
148,"I was lucky enough to find a very large bottle of Pi at a county fair in a kind of sunglasses and tshirts booth. I would say there was 1"" used from the bottle. The lady wanted $20. I offered $15 because it had no box and had been used. Deal. This is my all time favorite scent and I probably can't afford to buy a new bottle when this is gone. HIGHLY recommend. The scent is somewhat sweet, very soft, innocent, yet sexy. I am allergic to many perfumes/candles/etc. but this Pi is a DREAM.",5
148,"Pi by Givenchy, is the best fragrance ever. When my husband or sons were Pi, women of all ages ask what fragrance they are wearing! It is an amazing scent! Truely!",5
149,Awesome awesome awesome this is my 3rd bottle. This is a must have.,5
149,"L'Homme by Yves Saint Laurent - I first bought this scent about a year ago. It was the first time I'd smelled it and I loved it. I paid almost $140 for the 6.7 oz. bottle at an upscale department store. I was terribly disappointed with the fact that the scent does not project/last, at all! I've not gotten a single comment or compliment on it, not a single indication that it was ever even detected. I wear a large variety of great colognes, and get compliments all the time on them...but NOT a single one. I love it but won't buy it again. I tend to apply cologne very liberally; this is the only one I own that even I can't smell on myself 30 minutes later,",2
149,"Great this is the one i was looking for,for a long time,just love that saint perfume,and vot here early too,thankx.....",5
149,This is one of my favorite colonge it smells great I get alot of attention from co-workers. It makes good daytime wear.,5
149,Great cologne at good price,5
150,I loveee Coach Floral! My best friend had one from Macy’s which I fell in love with so I ordered it from here (almost half of what she paid) and it was the exact same thing. Now she uses mine. I wear it on special occasions and ALWAYS get compliments. ,5
150,"Lovely scent soft and feminine will purchase again, doesn’t last all day. ",4
150,The best among the best you can't go wrong on this one ,5
150,"This is my first time ordering from this site, and I'm not disappointed-shipment took about 4 days. The fragrance is exactly the same as I the sample sent from Coach ( I was skeptic that the scent might have been water-down or saturated with alcohol). Nice discount. Great shipping speed. Nice product.",5
150,"In love with coach, authentic perfume, with reasonable prices, now u can smell rich for less ",5
151,"Absolutly love the recent purchase I've made of the Estee lauder's sent, knowing. Long lasting and distinct. My new signature scent. Not too overwhelming yet noticeablely classic. My favorite. I highly recommend Knowing. I love this great scent and will buy it again.",5

151,"Knowing is very special, not to strong or weak, it has a catchie scent that attracts comments (nice ones) an makes me feel special at the same time. Gets a “10” from me. Ellen in Three Oaks Mi.",5
152,"My first two fragrances I wore in my life were Paco Rabanne and Gentleman by Givenchy. I wore them both quite regularly in my early days and they both bring back very good memories. I still wear them to this day and they still smell the same (except I think Givenchy is fiddling around with the formulation for Gentleman, so I don't know if it will change and become something completely different--I hope not). I was fortunate to purchase two 33.6-ounce bottles a few years back, so those should last quite a while. I give Paco Rabanne five stars for being so fresh, unique, and lovely. If you like Paco Rabanne, you might also like Bogart Pour Homme (by Jacques Bogart) because they smell very similar.",5
152,PACO RABANNE SMELLS GREAT VERY CLEAN,5
152,"Recently purchased Paco Rabanne EDT. Smells like 'After shave lotion', it's bad. ",1
152,"Recently purchased Paco Rabanne EDT. Smells like 'After shave lotion, it's bad. Sorry",1
152,Recently purchased Paco Rabanne edt and I really like this scent. It is much different from the sweet designer colognes in the market today. It is bright and green with a strong 'zest'from the inset. Great bargain price for a classic. Thank you!,5
153,"Tom Ford Black Orchid I could just cry- I finally have a bottle of the real thing! The scent that it should be! So many fakes out there- not this one from FragranceNet! Black Orchid is hard to describe, and I really can't, except that it is like nothing else and smells fantastic to me! If you want to stand out in a crowd, this is for you. Don't blind buy it, though. Ask for a sample and smell for yourself if it is right for you. It is that unusual.",5
153,"Black Orchid is one of my favorite Tom Ford Perfume. The smell is so unique, soft and last all day! I always get compliments whenever I wear it, which makes me feel good!

153,Tom Ford Black Orchid. Just ordered my 3rd bottle. That's because inhad to order my mom and two sisters a bottle after they drove me absolutely nuts about this perfume! I have NEVER left the house wearing this absolute gem without at least a handful of compliments. Mostly women! Its without a doubt the best smelling perfume I have ever worn. ,5
154,"Este es mi Colonia favorita de todo los perfume que e tenido y es que es increíble, una aroma delicada y cuando te la aplicas desapareces y cres que qué desaparece pero se me acercan y me dicen que rico hueles y todavía no me gustaba hasta qué pasó una persona que tenía una aroma increíble y le pregunté como se llama tú fragancia (Clinique de happy) Dios asi de rico olías",5
154,"I got surprised with the cologne, the fragrance is acceptable but does not last.",3
154,"I have used this cologne before, so I knew what I was getting. I love this cologne, as it is simple, pleasant scent without any overbearing notes.",5
154,Love this cologne. My husbands all time favorite,5
154,Also got for a friend Clinque happy for men.,5
155,"/bvlgari-omnia-crystalline This is the perfect light floral fragrance with hints of Gardenia. I purchased the small size for travel, as I have the large bottle at home. It allows me to wear my favorite perfume while on my trips and at home. I always get compliments on how good it smells. It is a light fragrance, but it really makes a statement whenever I wear it. ",5
155,"Bvlgari Omnia Crystalline is my all time favorite scent. I wear it EVERYDAY!!! So many people ask what I'm wearing....honestly, I never tell them the truth (don't want everyone smelling like me). Sorry. I get soooo many compliments daily on this scent. Love it, Love it, Love it!!!",5
155,"Oh my gosh,I found this fragrance by mistake, but out of the blue people that pass me will ask, what is the fragrance you are wearing? It smells heavenly. One time I went to A CAFETERIA IN HOSPITAL AND THE MAN BEHIND GLASS ASK ME WHAT IS THAT FRAGRANCE AND I SAID HOW COULD YOU SMELL ME WITH ALL OF THAT FOOD? HE SAID i DONT KNOW, BUT I WANT TO WRITE THE NAME DOWN. i SAID BULGARI OMNI CRYSTALLINE!!! WOW!!",5
155,Bvlgari Omnia Crystaline This is my signature scent and I get constant complements about how wonderful I smell! I try to make sure I have a bottle on hand at all times as I just cannot run out of my perfect fragrance! It’s the gift I always ask for! The best!!,5
155,Bvlgari I love it everywhere I go people tell me how good I smell I wish it came in a bigger bottle. That's one of my main fragrances that I purchase all the time. And the price is better than Macy's. Awesome perfume,5
156,My husband loves the green 8 oz polo after shave but you do not have it very often. I hope in the future you will have it more often. Thank you Faith Bloomfield ,5
156,"I buy the Polo green for my Dad because he and my Mom love it, but he also likes the after shave that goes with it, but it's hard to find. Seems like sets in other polo colors are available, but not the green. I hope in the future it will be available more.",5
156,I LOVE THE 8OZ. GREEN SPRAY TESTER BOTTLES. SORRY THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE. I WILL BUY 3 BOTTLES AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. PLEASE CONTACT ME. OR JUST SEND THEM AND BILL ME.,5
156,"Polo green, di Ralph Lauren è ormai diventato il ""mio"" profumo da alcuni anni. In questo negozio ho sempre trovato i prezzi migliori, per questo quando vado in USA mi faccio spedire qualche flacone al mio albergo, evitando così i costi di spedizione e di sdoganamento. ",5
156,"Ralph Lauren Polo (original) is a favourite with my husband and myself, a crisp green fresh scent that lingers. It's a classic scent that I hope will never go out of production!",5
157,Tommy Hilfiger 5-27-19 I bought This Tommy Hilfiger for me I'm a female...LOL after spraying it on me Notice it's a MEN'S COLOGNE NOT A WOMEN'S COLOGNE!! YES I KNW THEY HAVE Tommy Girl BUT NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS TO BE NOTHING BUT WOMEN'S LINE OF COLOGNE.. IN THE DESCRIPTION ON THIS COMPANY'S PAGE IT SHOULD SAY:: MEN'S COLOGNE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GESSH WHAT A Shock that was... YES IT WAS Tommy Hilfiger Men's Cologne ,4
157,Tommy Hilfiger by Tommy Hilfiger is always a staple.,5
157,I absolutely love my Tommy Hilfiger cologne and the discounts that your site offers on all products. I have worn this cologne all my life and it's nice to get it at such an amazing price!! 5 star rating!! ,5
157,"Original Tommy is Still my favorite, I have worn this since the early 2000's off and on. It has very obviously been reformulated and is weaker than my 1st bottle from the late 90's, However I have noticed that the (new packaging) bottles smell much stronger than the bottles I bought in 2012 and 2015. I hope this is a sign that Tommy Hilfiger is taking this product seriously again. I love it and recommend it to anyone and everyone! ",5
157,I like it. My wife think it “smells good”. It’s a winner in my book. 4-5 sprays and still smelling it 8 hours later. ,5
158,"This fragrance has changed, and is not nearly as appealing as the original.",2
158,I've used Passion by Elizabeth Taylor for years. This is my signature fragrance. The price is awesome and I never go a day without someone asking me what the fragrance is. I tell them and then let them know that they can't beat your prices for any of their fragrance needs.,5
158,This is a lovely scent......the cologne is perfect for Summer wear. ,5
158,"I have been wearing Elizabeth Taylor’s Passion perfume for at least 25 years! I have tried other perfumes at different times, but I always have gone back to Passion. It’s the only fragrance I’ve worn which has drawn compliments from both men and women. Most importantly, I’ve always loved the fragrance; the floral element is not overwhelming. I wear it any time of day, to work and In the evening.",5
158,Passion by Elizabeth Taylor. Been using it for years. I love it and get a lot of compliments. ,5
159, When i first smell this wasent to good. but after about 30 minutes i fall in love with this scent.,5
159,This is my favorite been using it since I was teen.,5
159,The colognes that I ordered are the only ones I have ever worn. I’m 63 years old and they’re my favorites and I’d like to think of them as my signature fragrances!,5
159,This is great. It's not overpowering. ,5
159," I'm Alright with Farenheit...This classic fragrance is a perfect fit, just like, a hand in glove, and accommodating with my body chemistry... Never outdated, I Love it, and so do The Lovely Ladies!",5
160,"I loved Mac Jacobs Decadence when I smelled it on my niece, however I was scared it wouldn't have the same effect on me because perfume scents do not last on me. Well I tell you, I ordered it and have never been happier to purchase a perfume. When I wear it to work everyone always says ""oooh you smell good"". When I think the scent has waned off, someone will walk in my office and say you smell good. This is my new signature scent, thank you marc Jacobs..",4
160,"I LOVE IT, but... Here me out. It’s woody, powdery, amber and dark fruit. It screams, “I’m the woman in charge” and any woman wearing would command the room. However, I’ve noticed women love this scent, for the bold and daring woman this is amazing. Men, however, I’ve heard it smells like an old lady. Not one your average man would find attractive or sultry, not even intriguing. On a night where compliments are not a concern, go for it. But if compliments is what your fishing for, skip this one IMO. Five stars from me! Male review, not so much. ",5
160,"Marc Jacobs Decadance, for the bold and the beautiful! This scent is daring, unique and oh so strong. Not headache inducing strong but definitely not for the subtle type. Not your average sweet nectar that everyone reverts to. If you want to say, “I’m the woman in charge” then rock this for the evening. Too bold for a daily signature scent imo, and according to most men I’ve asked, it smells like a “mature woman” scent. Does that mean I smell like an old lady??? Either way, it’s daring. So go for it! ",5
160,Marc Jacobs Decadence Omg this fragrance has an amazing scent...,5
160,Decadence is truly decadent and super sexy. My signature scent since 2016. ,5

162,I have been wearing Shalimar for years. I had a friend who wore it one day back in the late 60's and I asked her what she was wearing and she said Shalimar. I could only find it at Macy's and it was very expensive but I bought it anyway. Then when I got married my husband would buy it for me every Christmas. He died in 2002 and I still have the last bottle that he gave me. But I wear it every day when I work and everyone tells me how good I smell. I just love Shalimar and will be wearing it until I die.,5
162,I've been wearing shalimar since the 60s when I was a teenager. I'm now much older lol but still in love with the delishious scent. Its light sweet and smells fabulous. My signature scent for life. ,5
162,I love the perfume the spray on the bottle is damaged. Hard to spray and when it does it's to much.,4
162,I have used Shalimar by Guerlain for the past 45 years and absolutely love the alluring and intoxicating fragrance. There isn't a day that goes by that at least 2 people compliment me on my perfume. Day time or night time is the appropriate time to wear this perfume and the fragrance never changes no matter when I've applied it. ,5
162,"I am 79 years old and have worn Shalimar since a very young girl. I just love this perfume. This is one of my luxury treats that I buy for myself. My one son buys it for me every so often. To me the smell is the same as when I fist used it. Very feminine, pleasant odiferous aroma, love it.",5
163,Awesome fragrance!!! I love it!,4
163,Creed Silver Mountain Water is by Far the nicest Eau de Parfum. I have had only 1 or 2 come close to this wonderful stuff. Lots of comment's from both women and men all wanting to know what i am wearing. Always great quality products. well worth the extra expense. Have tried many other Creed products ALL excellent however this is the Best.,5
163,"Hello, After discovering the Creed brand at Neiman Marcus sometime back, I initially stayed back because of the hefty 395$, I mean yikes! Thanks to this site I was able to purchase several bottles among Creed Himalaya, and Creed Millesime Imperial. Concerning this cologne. Being produced in 1995, it's initial top notes are incomparable to what's in production today (which is a good thing). I'm getting 5 hours max until a skin scent, but I don't need a cologne to be on my skin all day. Would recommend =-) Will buy gain =-) (and from here of course since it's super cheap) ",4
163,A good investment..reminds me of Dior Aux Savage...certainly glad to have gotten it at a good price...,5
163,This cologne is the best smelling juice around. I love it and my wife does also. I wore this on my wedding day!,5
164,"I have been wearing Jennifer Lopez's Still for years. It is my absolute FAVORITE scent (as well as my husband's), the one I reach for automatically and reorder again and again. I receive many compliments and requests for the name of the perfume I'm wearing. It is a fresh, feminine, romantic scent without being sickeningly sweet or heavy. ",5
164,I first smelled Still on my hair stylist when it first came out I brought it for myself and it became one of my all time favorite scents.I can't tell you how many times a guy has told me how nice I smell when I'm wearing it. I love it's fresh light clean smell. ,5
164,Great smell. Bought as a gift for someone and turned around and bought one for me. Jennifer STILL.,5

166,Mild and sweet. I won’t get tired using this. ,5
166,"I forgot how amazing this scent is. My girlfriend asked me to purchase her a bottle so I purchased one for myself as well. It had been approx 6-8 years since I last wore this perfume. Needless to say, I am happy she requested a bottle. I will continue wearing this, along with my other favs. This is a must have!!! ",5
166,LOVE THE COLOGNE! My altime favorite,5
166,I am so incredibly picky when it comes to my perfume. Ive been searching for a new one since prescriptives calyx was sold and the fragrance was changed slightly. Years ive been searching for a new scent to call my own......then i smelled this by Dolce and Gabbana!!! I knew right away that i had finally found what id been looking for. Shipping took forever but definitely worth the wait! Thank you!!!!,5
166,Love love this every time I wear it I get ask what I am wearing I keep buying it I will not have this in My perfume collection,5
167,Burberry Britt Sheer is Wonderful! I get compliments all the time. ,5

167,"I really like Burberry Brit Sheer. I've been wearing it for some years now. Gotta get my sister one in May for her birthday! She smelled it on me and loves it :) Nice, clean, earthly scent.",5
168,"I'm disappointed with the Blue Grass deodorant fragrance, I'm not keen on the scent of spices. I much prefer my White Diamonds, Tabu, and Red Door. they have a much more feminine fragrance Blue Grass has a mild woody scent not sweet, too musty.",2
168,"I have used Blue Grass cream deodorant since the 1970's,,,I would never change it works excellent, my granddaughters now use it too...a great product..",5
168,"I purchased Blue Grass deodorant online after reading many positive reviews. When the product arrived, I opened the bottle and took a whiff to sample the scent. My first impression was that I thought the scent was a horrible! I put the product aside and wondered if I would ever use it. After about one week, I reluctantly decided to give Blue Grass a try. To my surprise, the fragrance is actually very nice on my skin! Not only is the fragrance nice, it is also a very effective deodorant! It does not specify on the bottle, but it is also seems to have a mild antiperspirant affect. There are quite a few online complaints about the quirky way the product dispenses, but for a quality product, I am able to tolerate a few technical quirks. Will definitely purchase again. Two thumbs up!!! ",5
168, I WOULD NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE. My two daughters agree,4
168,Very good! I like it.,5
169,The best perfume hands down beauty by Calvin Klein the fragrance smells wonderful I get so many compliments from total strangers will always order it love it,5
169,Beauty BY Calvin Klein This perfume is so light its enticing . When you pass some one in the summer hot and sweaty and they say i like that is it you. Or get a hug and again they say whats that I like it. Beauty BY Calvin Klein and Envy me by Gucci are both for up close conversation not over-barring. For any one that do not like heavy loud perfume either one you can not go wrong. ,5
169,"I don't think Calvin Klein has ever created a fragrance I've disliked. Over the holidays, my loved one sent me various CK perfume over the course of the two weeks preceding Christmas, and what a pleasure it was to greet the delivery man every couple of days. I finally decided to buy one of my own selection just prior to Valentine's Day and chose the lovely, deep scent of Beauty; as always, I'm very pleased. Calvin Klein has become something of a signature scent as well as a lasting favorite for me, and Beauty is just another reason why. ",5
169,"Very nice fragrance that my wife has worn for years. Not sold in stores anymore, luckily we found it on your website and at a great price!",5
169,It's absolutely perfect .,5
170,Love this scent!! And so happy I found it for a great price!,5
170,"My three favorites are Flowerbomb, Crystal Nior by Versace, and Truth or Dare by Madonna. If you like one of them, chances are that you will love all of them. When my budget is tight I buy the Truth or Dare because it’s the least expensive. Crystal Nior is my next choice if I can spend more and Flowerbomb is when I get to treat myself to the one I love the most. Try them all, you’ll get lots of compliments on them all and you will love them yourself. Oh and to get the stuff that stays on longer you need to buy perfume not cologne or eau de toilette.",5
170,I have been wearing Flowerbomb by Viktor & Rolf for many years. Love it! Soft & not overpowering. Also love Extreme.,5
170,I’ve had almost 10 bottles of Flowerbomb I so love this perfume it’s soft and smooth smells very good . One of my favorites,5
170,"My sister introduced me to Flowerbomb and i have been wearing it ever since! My husband & son like it too. It's a bit pricey but we'll worth it! I get compliments constantly when I'm out! Its a scent that works for any age. Both my sisters (early 50's) and their 3 daughters (ages 21,26 & 28) all love & wear Flowerbomb daily! ",5
171,The greatest cologne ever.,5
171,My favorite cologne of all time. I love to smell it on my husband. :),5
171,This scent is a show stopper! Every one wants to know what it is...the ladies like it on me!,5
171,"Nice fragrance, I will recomend it. Average performance 4 to 6 hrs. ",4
171,"Scent: 5/10 Value: 7/10 Longevity: 7/10 Sillage: 7/10 Versatility: 7/10 The opening is apple and black pepper all the way. I literally want to eat the opening. The dry down is a combo of sweet and spicy with a bit of a powdery note which usually comes from labdanum or amber. I'm a big fan of the opening, but the dry down seems to be lacking something. It's odd, but I get a lighter side of Reflection Man by Amouage without the strong metallic feel. It's also a little sweeter than Reflection Man. The sillage is above average in my opinion, and the longevity is also very good. It seems versatile enough to be worn in various settings and is definitely a ""classy"" scent. The longevity is great; I get around 8 hours on clothing (maybe a little longer). Sillage and projection are also above average. The dry down will last and leave you with the Reflection Man vibe I mentioned above. My wife is not crazy about the scent. She thinks it's a bit too powdery on the dry down. Overall this is a great cheapy to have in your collection. I admire this one enough to keep wearing it, but it will not be a repeat buy.",3
172,Yes! This is the perfume I've been waiting for!!! It wears beautifully. It lasts forever. I can't stop smelling myself and I get compliments everywhere. I am absolutely addicted!,5
172,I absolutely love Betsy Johnson pretty N’ punk! I received another perfume for a gift and the sample of Betsy Johnson was in the box. Once I smelled it I absolutely loved it and ordere it that same day. The scent is long lasting and intoxicating in my opinion. I also love the packaging of the perfume.. so cute! If you like heavy scents that are spicy you will love this perfume. ,5
172,I love it the scent is amazing and stays with me all day long would buy it again,5
172,This perfume Betsy Johnson Pretty N Punk is great I like the smell its just that i'm a little bit disappointed because it not last long.,3
172,Pretty N punk smells wonderful but doesn’t stay with you very long ,3
173,"A friend bought me this perfume as a gift. It smelled wonderfully & amazing. Long lasting too.I've gotten so many compliments on how I smell. I rushed thru the bottle because of my new found love for this perfume. It's all done now, so I decided to order a bottle for myself. I received the perfume sometime in January and I only used it on Tuesday. Long story short, this is not the same perfume I've used and came to love. The scent is very faint and it doesn't last at all. If you dont care about buying something that's a fraction of the real stuff for $70 go ahead. But trust me, you will definitely love the real deal. Pay $20 more at Perfume counters and have a keeper for life.",1

Personally, this fragrance has an interesting smell when first detected, but if you're near someone for a while it begins to turn a little nauseous and, in my opinion it's, an overbearing fragrance that smells as if it was layered with essential oils and womens perfumes. Not a fan of Terre D' Hermes. ",2

205,I love L'Air du Temps! My mom wore it when I was growing up and I always loved it. Now I wear it while my own kids are growing up. It's my favorite perfume. ,5
205,'Air du Temps by Nina Ricci is one of my favorites for the summer months. A,5
205,"I love L'Air Du Temps and have used it for over twenty years. It is such a lovely, light fragrance that always gets compliments from many ladies. I also love the L'Air Du Temps body cream. It is definitely a classic wonderful fragrance. I love wearing it! Never stop selling it! Written by Kathy on July 4, 2019 ",5
205,"This is a question: I have a lovely gold travel size container of L'Aire du Temps, that is made up of an enclosed glass cylinder that contained 7.5 ml/.25 oz of perfume. Is a refill for this available?",5
206,"I have been using burberry brit for a long time. I think the product is well made and I enjoy the fragrance. However, I can't find the the same scent in aftershave balm. Is that available?",5
206,Nice but Burberry Touch better.,4
206,I absolutely loved it!!,5
206,I’ve used Burberry Brit for years and it’s nice to see I can order it in larger sizes and reasonable prices !!!!,5
206,"Really like Burberry Brit, nice clean fragrance, have received many complements on it, was using Boucheron for years and have switched to the Brit more and more",5

207,Have not yet received my perfume,1
208,"Casmir, so disappointed. It's for a very mature woman who wants to smell that way.",1
208,"Casmir eau de parfum by Chopard was a winner for me from the first sample, I wore it for years and then had a hard time finding it. I had not had any for years until I came across this site and was thrilled to find it. It is a wonderful fragrance and I will purchase it again,Suzanne",5
208,"Casmir is a sweet, rich, sandalwood. I bought this for myself first, blind buy, but it was far too heavy for me. But both my father and a male friend took one sniff and said, ""This is for us!"" So I'm buying this for my dad for his 81st birthday. He loves it. Don't be afraid to wear or to buy this for yourself, if you're a gentleman. It may be sweet, but it's not fruity or floral, and it's a sandlewood bomb. Plus, the longevity and sileage blast any weak mens eau de toilette out of the park. ",5
208,"This perfume has a distinct scent which appeals to me and my hubby. Whenever I wear it, it reminds me of the song, Kashmir by Led Zepplin, one of my favorites along with Carouselambra. I've been out out it for quite awhile because of its cost as I'm retired and 79 years old. Just couldn't resist this time as we sold our home and moved into a senior living center.",5
208,"This is for the mature, confident woman. It's laid back, sexy, smooth, and men love it. I just spray a little on and WOW I feel in command. It's powdery and warm. This parfum will make you feel beautiful whether in jeans or evening wear! I love it!",5
209,"I am like every one else I been wearing it since it came out. Men, women, and grandchildren say I smell good. There was also a lotion which I wish they still made. Liz Claiborne this light mix of natural greens and white lily works with my body chemicals and I have not found any other fragrance that does. Thank you so much for keeping it in stock ",5
209,Liz Claiborne is very nice perfum For women’s Thanks Shyam ,4
209,I have worn Liz Claiborne for too many years to remember. I love it and receive many compliments when wearing it. It is becoming increasingly hard to find. Pleased to find it here!,5
209,"Liz Clairborne is the ONLY cologne I have ever worn since they started making it. I used to wear ""BABE"" but when they stopped making it I almost had a breakdown. I had to go without cologne for almost a month because I could not find anything I liked at ALL. Then Liz came out with this and I was instantly in love. People say they ""smell"" be before they see me if I walk up behind them.... and they instantly know I am there. My husband constantly told me how wonderful I smell... even after we were divorced. Getting hard to find this cologne. I am so happy you still carry it!! I can never wear anything else!!",5
209,I have been using Liz Claiborne since 1987 when a friend gave me some for my Birthday . There is nothing out there I like better than it. Bath and body works doesn't hold a candle to Liz Claiborne.,5

210,Love this. This is my second bottle.,5
210,"Curve Crush is by far my favorite perfume. It stays on all day and the scent is not over powering. I also get a ridiculous amount of compliments too. Everyone always asks, what perfume do you have on. This is definitely my every day perfume!",5
210,I GET MORE COMPLIMENTS WHEN I WEAR THIS PERFUME THAN ANY OTHERS I HAVE ,5

211,I love Lucky You I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it too,5
211,"I've always been a fan of Lucky You! Everywhere I go, I am always complimented that I smell good and then asked what the name of perfume is called. I am more of the sweet, fruity smells vs. musky, bold smell. I highly recommend this perfume for any age groups. Not too strong for your daughter/niece/sister but just enough",5
211,This perfume is a classic for me. I first wore this perfume when my mother bought it for me back in 2003 as a Christmas gift. Ever since I smelled this beautiful scent I have not been able to shake it. I'm so glad I was able to find it at such a great price on this site. Will be buying more. ,5

Was so excited to find this site with some amazing fragrance offers on some of my absolute favorite peefumes including my long lost love Paloma Picasso!! This fragrance truly will get you noticed!! Love it!,5

215,"VERY peppery scent overall, its hard to smell anything else right away but the dry-down is great",5
216,Have used nothing but White Diamonds for many years and everyone always tells me how wonderful this fragrance is on me.,5

219,"Omnia Coral by Bvlgari has been one of my favorite go-tos since I found it years ago. It's scent is light, but lasts all day. LOVE it!",5
219,Got the Bvlgari Omnia Coral for my girlfriend birthday she is in love with it. ,5
219,"I tried this once in a Perfume store here in NYC and I loved it. I have specific tastes when it comes to perfume and this one is exactly it. It's fresh, and it's like a burst of citrusy beautiful scent! I always said that if the color Coral had a scent it would smell like this.. It's not overly sweet. It's fresh and clean and at first it seems to be a little strong, but after the drydown it's beyond beautiful. I get asked constantly what I'm wearing. I would wear this all year long but I save it for the summer because it reminds me of summer. I have a larger bottle at home and I carry a bottle to work with me. I also spray it on my wrist before I go to sleep because I just love it that much. Some of the scents that I wear are Jimmy Choo, Vince Camuto's Bella, Christian Siriano's Silouette, Dolce and Gabbana Ligt Blue, and there are more. I'm a bit of a perfume junkie. However in my opinion, this is in a class of it's own.",5
219,"I LOVE Coral by Bvlgari!! I use the lotion and cologne and received numerous compliments on how ""good I smell"" by men and women. I'm a cashier. I'm sad that I had a difficult time buying it at stores. Most don't carry it or the lotion. I only wear this fragrance!!!!",5
219,"I don’t even remember how I found Bvlgari’s Omnia Coral fragrance, but I haven’t been without it since. It is my signature scent, and I wear it daily. The only time I ever change is to avoid becoming nose-blind to it. I have never been stopped in my tracks so many times by complete strangers just to have them compliment me on my fragrance. It lingers all day, but is still light enough for anyone who is sensitive to smells (like me).",5
220,"This is my fragrance forever, I have tried sooo many scents including oils etc for years, nothing surpasses the smell of Burberry Touch perfume for women in my opinion. I am desperately searching for the ""Burberry Touch perfumed cream"" If anyone could inform me of where to locate this cream I would be eternally grateful, the smell is to die for, I get so many compliments when I combine the both of them. If I could I would give them 10 stars each, both the perfume and the perfumed cream",5
220,I wasn't very impressed with the Bureberry Touch fragrance. I feel that it made me smell old and musty. But that is just my opinion. ,1
220,Burberry Touch is wonderful for day and night I couldn’t be more pleased I was looking for a go to fragrance for everything and everyday. And I have finally found it. Perfection !!!!!!,5
220,I love the scent. Perfect for spring.,5
220,I love the scent of Burberry Touch!! This is absolutely One of my favorite fragrances!!,5
221,"Smells like Chanel man ideal - black top bottle, Chergei and Tom Ford Tobacco Vanilla. To me they are all in the same family. Sweet, dark, spicy, chocolatey, masculine, sexy. Projects well for 2-4 hours, then close to the skin. Best for cool nights, cool and rain days or fall/winter. Very well balanced fragrance. This is a repeat buy!! My new fav! Creed Aventus (Armaf too ;), Varvatos Dark Rebel, Prada L'Homme, Dior Man... and I'm searching for my next must keep fragrance for my collection - I have others but these are essential.",5
221,"Great Price, great scent. Loved it so much I had to buy the whole collection.",5
221,"john-varvatos dark rebel Just recently got it... I’m impressed, it’s like love at first site, I sprayed it on my body and I been feeling happy all day today and now it’s 10:09 pm and I’m still smelling wonderful, it goes well on my skin, this is a great fragrance, awesome, just got it by reading the reviews. And it’s better than what I expected will be sticking with this for a while ",5
221,Dark Rebel at first smells like cherry/vanilla and I was very surprised then it turns into a very sex woody leather fragrance the way like it but can do better in the longevity performance,4
221,John Varvatos Dark Rebel is one of my favorite fragrances in my small collection it was a blind buy I had never heard of the John Varvatos house. but I'm so glad I took a chance on it. It's a very masculine fragrance with a mysterious vibe my wife loves it. Its performance could be better it last about 3-4 hours but then after that people have to be very close in order to get a smell of it. Can't beat the fragrance net price i will definitely be buying another bottle well before this one runs out,5
222,Versace Yellow Diamond Intense is very nice to wear. Strong at first and lasts the whole day long.,5
222,"Lovely, Delivered fast, Thank you.",5

224,Paco Rabanne 1 million Prive is a great fragrance. I purchased it in a blind sample lot and as not disappointed. ,5
224,Great !!!!! Fast shipping smells great ,5
224,"Better than the original, which I thought would be a hard thing to do. Nothing but complements. People often say, definitely keep this bottle in my arsenal. And I will!",5
224,Paco Rabanne 1 million prive. Good fragrance ,5
225,Smells good. It’s a old school cologne that a lot of youngsters don’t know about but when they smell it. They be like coach you smell good.,4
225,My husband has been using Royal Copenhagen for 40 years. He gives gifts of other colognes away. I love the aroma. He is a Royal Copenhagen man.,5
225,"Royal Copenhagen was a cologne that my father used. I loved the smell , so I started using it , really appreciated all the great complements, but it was out of my price range . but now I can afford it I will buy it all the time .",5
225,"Bought this for my husband as I can't resist the scent and it lasts for hours and hours,Royal Copenhagen really is a sexy scent for your husbands /boyfriends ladies.",5

226,"It is AMAZING to have found Ysatis. I have used this perfume for the past 38 years. People give me compliments on the fragrance, and how pleasant is smells. I love that the fragrance stays with me for more than 24 hrs., I have test this theory! I'm looking for the body cream to combine and compliment the effect on my body, and the fragrance last even longer. I hope this perfume stays in the market forever. I may have to stock-up, lol, lol",5
227,"I absolutely love the scent of White Shoulders; I started wearing it when I met my husband's (at the time, finance's) Great Aunt Agnes, who was wearing it. Haven't worn any other scent since, and that was 44 years ago. It's a delicate scent, which I receive complements on often.",5
227,I am allergic to so many scents. I started using White Shoulders when I was 18 and am now 72. I have strangers come up to me and ask what cologne I am wearing? One man wanted to get it for his wife. A woman standing next to me in the store said I smelled wonderfully delicious. ,5
227,I have worn White Shoulders since I was 16. My aunt introduced it to me as it was her signature. I am now 86 yrs. iold.,5

I, too have always gotten compliments and have been told that it is you wearing the scent and not it wearing you. Chloe was the gift that my husband knew I would love regardless of the occasion. I have tried the other but just plain Chloe is my love. It is just the perfect blend, you can not improve it because it is Chloe and it is PERFECT. Please never touch it ,just keep it as it is.",5
228,"I have worn Chloe since 1980 and love it. Have tried other fragrences, but Chloe is just ""me"" and I gave up trying others. Thank you fragrance net for carrying it! ",5

228,Chloe edt by Chloe is the only fragrance that loves me....ad I love it right back...,5
229,"It's a clean, fresh scent though not long lasting on me. If I hadn't ALSO ordered Eau de Cartier, Cartier Basier Vole, and Calvin Klein Eternity in same shipment, Jennifer's scent might have stood out more. But up against this collection above. Love them all!",3
229,"This is the first fragrance I've used other than my Oscar for 40 yrs. the first time I smelled it was in a sample from your collection. I instantly fell in love with Jennifer Aniston by Jennifer Aniston, It's fresh smelling and has that edgy hint of flirty acidity. Love this floral delight. Thank you Ms. Aniston for this wonderful fragrance. ",5
229,"I love this fragrance. It is light and fresh. Every time I wear it I get compliments. I own several expensive perfumes but I never get the compliments I get with Jennifer Anniston's fragrance. I have worn Lancome for many years, but I am going to make Jennifer Anniston my signature perfume.",5

230,"I ordered and received my Fire and Cologne and I Am well pleased with my purchase. Thank You, Sincerely Maretha Price",5
230,"I tend to use fragrances like signatures. When I have a scent I love and the manufacturer takes it off the shelf, I'm forced to find another. Fire & Ice was like that for me when I discovered it in college. It's one of my favorites even today. Fire & Ice is marvelously feminine, light and lingering, like a memory or afterthought you don't want to lose. When I'm dressed in a ""perfect"" look for a particular event, Fire & Ice gives me that ""sense"" of completion. It's perfect for me, one of my signatures! Thank you for making it available to me again.",5
230,I wear this perfume all of the time! I make sure and reorder before I run out! I get complimented on my perfume all of the time and asked oh my what are you wearing? I absolutely love ordering from your website! You're fast on deliveries I've been shopping your website for years!,5
231,"Azzaro Legend Chrome is the best, using for a years :)",5
231,The top two Azzaro Chrome flankers are Pure and Legend with Intense coming in 3rd. I did not care for United that much. Legend is a beast in my opinion. The smell of sweet apples is what you first smell when you spray it on. It projects really well and has a longevity of 8 plus hours. Everyone absolutely loves this scent. My wife said I could throw everything else away and just wear this. That's how much she likes it. The only thing I don't like about it is this new bottle with the slim cap. It is very hard to get on and off. Other than that it will remain in my collection for summer wear forever!,5
231,Chrome Legend is my number one fragrance. I get more compliments when I wear it then any other scent.,5
231,Azzaro Chrome Legend is a Very good Cologne I got a lot of compliments from other men asking what i was wearing because they liked it and wanted to buy it. It is also very well priced,5

232,I absolutely love this perfume and smell and yes it’s powerful but it works so well it’s a very sweet sent and naturally everyone will have a different perspective we all don’t have the same smell when wearing certain types of perfume our body has different kinds of chemistry to everything! I can’t use tide yet some swear by it !,5
232,"absolutely love it!! best fragrance ever, been using it for years since my youngest son gave it to me for Christmas years ago. Ive bought different perfumes, but always come back to this one!!",5
233,I was sent a sample of this fragrance and fell in love with it! BUT I can't find it anywhere to buy. I keep hoping fragrance net will have more than a sample to offer. The scent is light and fresh and easy to wear.,5
233,"I received a sample of DIANE. I love the fragrance,but I'm not going to order it just to get another sample size. I'd pay more just to have it sent to me. I'll keep checking to see if it'll come in a larger bottle.",5

233,"I love this perfume,,(Diane). Why isn't it available in a bottle?",5
233,"I purchased a large bottle of this perfume and it's simply divine. Light, airy, fresh and flirty. I love walking past someone and they make positive comments on my lingering scent. It's good for day and night wear. It doesn't last all day, but it's worth spraying again. ",5
234,"It has been a long time since I last wore Gloria Vanderbilt. It is not easy to find. When I saw it on your sight, I had to get it! As soon as I received it, I just had to smell it. I then remembered why I loved this scent so much. The scent makes me feel classy and elegant.",5

I bought the large 5oz so the sales person gave me a handful of samples. 4 of them were Boss the scent intense. I was slightly bummed. But hey, they were free. Long story short i love it. Didnt expect to, but i think its an excellent fragrance. Not gonna lie, it only lasted 4 hours before it turned into a skin sent. But it projected really good for the first 2. For the price, this is a great evening fragrance. ",4

243,"Fancy was one of the greatest gourmands ever made. It was caramel sugar overdose, a glorious bomb. That was the original. I loved it. Recently bought it again, and it has obviously been reformulated. I could cry. It's a shadow of its former glory. The caramel and apple pie has been put on a diet, and the pear comes forward now. Who wants pear-!. Used to last all day, sugarcoating the walls and anyone near your orbit, and now, it has almost zero projection and longevity. It's been gutted. Oh Jessica, how could you DO this to us. So, so disappointed. Why do all great perfumes get destroyed this way?! 5 star for the original. 3 star for this poor travesty.",3
243,You feel fancy when you wear this fragrance I absolutely love it I feel like I'm mad at Big Dan's or greeting with important people is wonderful,5

No matter the age of a woman is adaptable for her. Everyone loves this fragrance; mostly men are in love with this fragrance. In a recent survey, this perfume has the top places for both women and men. The best of all is that is an economic fragrance that is compared to the most expensive fragrances.",5

246,Jovan white musk is a very light smelling musk. It would never overwhelm anyones nose. It is a scent that stays close to your skin and you get wiffs of It through out the day and people do smell you although it isn't strong. You can over apply and still wont offend or knock anyone out! Lol. I get 24 hours out of this musk and still smell it on my skin the next day! I love it!!! I'm a guy. And i wear it in confidence and people like the way i smell because of the numerous of compliments i always receive. They ask me all the time what am i wearing and i simply say its my secret! Lol.. I never tell what i am wearing and i dont feel bad about it. And its not because i feel ashamed to say it because its a womens frangrance. I think a frangrance should never be announced. Its a very personal thing to me. I like people to guess or continue to wonder what it is. Some may know and have a idea but more will wonder. Trust me!,5
246,Kogan White Musk smells so good ...I will be ordering it again...,5
246,"I've been using Jovan Musk since I was a teenager.. When the white musk came out I switched and never went back.. Everywhere I go, men and women say you smell so good.. Sometimes men just follow behind me to smell by body odor. My grandchildren and anyone that comes by, know my smell.. They always says you lying, you're not wearing, that cheap perfume.. I say it's not cheap perfume, it's better than the 100$ a bottle perfume.. White musk is very sensual ",5

250,I have been a faithful client of AZZARO for more than 30 years and would qualify as a Old Grandpa as I am 75 . I have always been complimented for my scent by others and been asked for the name of my fragrance . It is in my opinion the number one product from Loris Azzaro . ,5
250,"Azzaro Pour Homme is NOT for the common day lovers of the more sweeter colognes! This fragrance was made from the vintage times for men “ back in the day.” It’s an acquired scent that’s a classic, sexy, and very masculine. It is what u smelled like when coming from the barbershop with a lot more refinement. Just an awesome smell that still gets compliments to this very day! And the longevity & silage is beast mode!! ",5
250,"Azzaro pour Homme did not please my senses at all!! It reminded me of what old grandpa's from the 80s smelled like. With a release date of 1978, it no wonder why. I'm not sure which notes turn me off to this sent but it one fragrance I'll be be passing on....Maybe when I'm 70",1
250,I've been using Azzaro since 1986 and I have never found another scent that pleases me and other people more than Azzaro.,5

253,"Usher...is a good cologne ,it smells good on my husband!!!",5
253,"Usher known as ""The sent for Men"" is a very fresh and woodsy sent. The top notes of melon & pineapple give it the ""fresh feeling"" and the base notes of different woods leave you smelling manly & musky. Performance wise it's a little weak. This is one you'll have to re-apply through out the day which shouldn't be a problem with its excellent price point...I'll be picking up a bottle to add to the collection, why not? ",4
253,"I smell the Usher Cologne to the UPS guy in the doctor's office I work in, I followed him outside to ask him what cologne he had on and told me Usher cologne, the black box. I love it. The girls in the office said, wow he smell so good. I got one for my son and husband.",5
254,"White Linen has been my main go-to spring/summer fragrance for at least 30 years, unlike some of my former fragrances that no longer smell the same on me after menopause and chemo, The fragrance is a fresh, crisp, light floral. White Linen has never failed me and I thank Estee Lauder for not doing what so many other perfumers do when they decide to ""tweak"" a fragrance and end up changing it. This has remained true since it was introduced. Of the three fragrances Estee Lauder premiered that year, White Linen was the most successful and I can understand why.",5
254,"I have used Estee Lauder White Linen for over 20 years and love the clean fresh smell. I tried another fragrance for a change but switched back to White Linen recently. It was like coming home after a long trip away. I receive so many compliments when wearing White Linen, like ""oh, you smell so good"". I give White Linen 5 stars' One time a lady got on my sons bus and he told her, ""you smell like my Mom"" she said ""Thank you, its White Linen"" He replied, I think of my Mom every time I smell it, she smells so good. Will never switch again.",5
254,I love the White Linen fragrance by Ester Lauder. I have worn this scent for 30 years. I never get tired of the compliments I always Receive.,5

255,"I am a perfume collector. You name it, I have it. And I like them all. But, my all-time favorite and what I would consider my own “signature” fragrance is Mambo. It’s, by far, the sexiest smelling fragrance I use. It’s clean, spicy, fruity and warm all at the same time. Without being too much. Yet it has plenty of hang-time. I get the most compliments while wearing Mambo. I’ve been wearing it since it first came out. I was like, 18. And at 34, I still adore it. Perfect for women of any age. It smells expensive without being expensive. I just can’t say enough about it!",5

256,"Organza! I have worn this ever since it came out. I am told that I smell so good. I just to be able get it in a dry oil spray, oh my it was so great. Why doesn't fragrancenet not carry the body oil, powder, or dry oil spray. Wish I could find the body lotion or veil. What more could they sell",5
256,I have worn Organza cologne and body veil together for 30 years. I never leave the house that I don't get at least one compliment. I love it.,5

261,Hey wen @ Marcy’s last week to get my Versace blue had a change of mine price was too high so I beside to buy it fragrancenet and get it cheaper love it ,5
261,"Dylan Blue Pour Femme A floral-fruity perfume, best suited to daytime in the spring/summer. Top notes: black currant sorbet, granny smith apple, clover, forget-me-nots, shisolia Heart: Eglantine rose, petalia, rosyfolia, jasmine, ice infusion of peach Base: patchouli, styrax, white smooth woods, musk What I smell: a fresh, fruity-floral salon product; the scent is pleasant--a safe, inoffensive scent. To me, it's not a scent that would turn heads. Would be great for the office. Longevity: After 2 hours, there is a faint residue of a shampoo-like scent but only able to smell it when my nose is very close to my arm. Sillage: Soft Packaging: Very beautiful bottle, one of my favourites. Would I repurchase? Undecided. While I like the shampoo freshness of the scent, I expect better longevity out of a perfume at this price point. I feel as though there are other shampoo-like perfumes out there that cost less. ",3
261,This is my first Versace anything and I did good by guessing that this perfume would smell great. I like it alot. ,4

263,"Vince Camuto Bella. I love to smell good at all times and like when other compliment my perfume. Don't think Bella works for me. Although it smells soft and clean may be a bit too bland. I also tried Vince Camuto Ciao, is pretty and soft. So far Vincent Camuto Amoire, works for me, every time I wear i get compliments of how good I smell. :) ",3
263,I wear this as my daily perfume. It smells soo nice imo. I get lots of compliments. Only issue is I have to respray before end of day but that’s not a big deal because I have an atonomizer I save just for this perfume and refill as needed to keep in my purse. Absolutely LOVE it!! ,5

I put it on today about 5 hours ago, and it still smells fantastic. The reviewers that say it doesn't last must be buying it from Amazon. When you buy from Amazon, you never know what your getting, because they deal with so many distributors. Every time I have purchased my fragrances from FragranceNet I know I'm always getting the original scents. That's why I only use this website for great prices and the real thing. Still no problems in the last 13 years. ",5

267,First time trying this parfume Beyonce Heat. Im not much for a musk end tone to the fragrance but it lasts for hours you still have that faint alluring scent... My 25 year old daughter tried mine and loveddddd it. Will purchase again am curious on her other scents.. Now the Bob Mackie i love the crispness and fresh sweet scent my only downside doesnt last.. Is an older retro scent.. DON'T think i will buy it again.. i adore fragrance net prices they stand by what they sell for men n woman's fragrances... oh n my daughter ikes the Besty Jonhnson's Too Too..... ,5

269,This fragrance really is a masterpiece by Lalique. The opening is aromatic and green. I can really smell the vetiver and cypress. The cashmere wood shines through in the dry down. This is a rich and niche smelling fragrance. If you like masculine woody and earthy fragrances with a green background this is worth a blind-buy; because you can't go wrong. Perfect for fall and winter. Gorgeous fragrance. ,5
269,"I've been wearing Encre Noire by Lalique since 2007 and I have always gotten compliments. Always! Men, women... people ask me what it is and quite often even to write the name down. And once I have smelled a fragrance so elegant and refined on a friend some years ago, and when I asked what it was, he said ... Encre Noire! I can never smell it while wearing myself, so that was a once upon a time true olfactory experience! I have all three versions for different occasions, of course, yet the original scent is my signature still. The best vetiver based perfume so far for sure!",5
269,Encore Niore Scent was a perfect gift for my perfect man. I love it,5
269,Encre Noir.. An engulfing fragrance.,5

296,"Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet was more floral than the other Dior perfumes I tried but still not floral enough for me. Too spicy. I'm looking for something very floral, like fresh pure flowers.",3
296,I purchased the vial of Miss Dior Blooming bouquet. At first when I put it on I was underwhelmed as it didn't smell like anything special. It was almost non existent. As the day went on I was noticing this lovely soft scent floral scent. Almost like being in a garden of flowers. Not harsh; light. I smelled my wrist and it was the perfume. I came back online to see how much a bottle was and I noticed that it listed the scent as being introduced in 1981. I couldn't believe it. The scent smells very modern. So yes I will agree it is a timeless scent. Looking forward to a committing to a full bottle.,5

297,Red Door Body Lotion has an amazingly long lasting fragrance. I was pleasantly surprised by the scent. It is now my favorite body lotion and highly recommend it. ,5
298,"I love this fragrance. It's sweet yet masculine, perfect for a cuddle scent during cooler weather as well as suitable for warmer weather. This is a beautiful fragrance that needs to be in your collection. ",5
298,"I am not a perfumer and do not have a very keen nose. However I can say is that it is a good fragrance with notes of cinnamon, citrus, tobacco and cumin. The softer and heavier notes such as tobacco hits you a bit harder. However due to heat, it tones out and becomes some what of a skin scent. So it really isn’t a summer fragrance but I assume that it should be fine for winter and colder nights. Definitely is a manly fragrance. The bottle is refillable*, so if you get yours with a refillable bottle it’s probably because the of the batch. Don’t get alarmed, you should check the batch code when you receive it. Also on a side note, to clarify if anyone is purchasing from fragrance-net for the first time and shipping to Canada, I would say though the reviews for Landmark Global and Sprintstar Canada are terrible, they still shipped and delivered it on time to my address in Ontario. Either way you have customer support to help you out with. ",4
298,"I read great reviews on Azarro Wanted by Nights and had to get it and see for myself... This fragrance is magical and projects very well, could not keep the ladies off of me. Many complement every time I wear it, it's off the chain and a top in my collection!! ",5

300,Narciso Rodriguez for her is very pleasing to the sense of smell. When sprayed it seems to follow. Everyone seems to notice. This perfume is the one. The price is reasonable as well.

311,"I had a dior addict back in 2005ish as part of a miniture gift. It was my all time favorite. Absolutely, love it! It took me for a long time to consume the small bottle since using perfume where I work is not allowed and plus i alternate using perfurmes with other dior. So, to make the story short when I saw this online i decided to buy the biggest bottle i could get. In my own opinion, this perfume is not suitable for younger women. This is very strong dior addict. More musky not fresh, clean and feminine like the one that I had. ",2

314,Dark obsession it's great ir smells better than some of my more expensive Colognes,5

316,"Creed Millesime Imperial.....fresh, crisp and citrusy goodness. The beautiful melon note is a great surprise. ",5
317,Calvin Klein has outdone the competition with this one. Intense Euphoria is a scent directly from the Gods. It's appropriate for the outdoorsman for casual occasions and for those intimate times with your partner.,5
317,"This product Intense Euphoria is what my son use all the time, he loves it",5
317,Excellent I love it ,5

318,"So the open was a throat punch of fruit and straight patchouli, not what I was expecting. But the dry down was so much sweeter! Once it calmed down all the notes blended out, wow, what a lovely scent! Not an adolescent vibe at all. Sweet, fruity, lightly woody with a hint of patchouli. Very much so a more expensive smelling scent than your average celebrity fragrance. Well suited for a signature scent. I hear longevity can be an issue for some, so perhaps keep a spare spritzer in the handbag because for the price, you could bathe in it and it still be worth the buy.",5
318,Ordered Killer Queen from the ingredients that it contained. I was surprised at the way it became a very lovely fragrance that was feminine on me. I thought that it would be more like a fragrance that a man or woman could wear comfortably but I am glad that I gld it because it is a very lovely scent on. I would recommend any one giving it a try. ,5

319,"Wow, this juice is very nice. I purchased Prada Black last winter and loved it. So when I was in the market for some summer freshies I chose this, Chanell Allure Sport and Dunhill Icon. This one was my favorite as it seemed to last longer on my skin and suit. It's a freshie with just a slight hint of sweet. It last on my suit for a good 6 hours. It's not a Banger but it does have nice sillage and is quite noticeable. I was quite happy with this and Allure Sport. The Dunhill on the other hand....Or as my girlfriend calls it ""bandaid smell"". ",5
319,"I don't like it. I frigging LOVE it! I use it all the time, even during weekends at home to have its scent in my nose permanently.",5
319,"Prada Luna Rossa Sport is an awesome fragrance. As a female, I purchase this as one of my favorite go to scents. Originally received this as a sample when I ordered cosmetics.

322,Prada Carbon is top of the line fragrance and I get compliments all the time. I’m giving it four stars because it doesn’t have legs. It wears off after a few hours and has to be reapplied. This makes it even more expensive because I run out quicker.,4
322,Parda Luna Rossa Carbon smells amazing. A friend of mine tried it on @ Macy's and I fell in love with him lol...also bought some for my son for Christmas and he loves it.,5
322,Prada Carbon is the best.. ,5

One big bottle lasts me about 6 months too since a little goes a long way. Trust me, you won’t be disappointed in your purchase! ",5
329,"My daughter gave this wonderful fragrance to me, and I have fallen in love with it. My husband loves it, too!! This is the best fragrance I have ever experienced. Wish they had lotion, too.",5
329,"""Not a Perfume "" got the attenion of the Ladies in my dental office. They had to know ... it was so soft yet smelled wonderful was how they described it! When I told them 'Juliette Has A Gun' and Its called Not a Perfume. They said "" that actually makes since! Ha! I'm hooked! ",5
329,Very pretty but a bit of a heavy scent. It smells like Paloma Picasso with under tones or rose. I love it and kept smelling myself all day. Would buy it again.,4
330,"I have used Romance before, and I love the smell. It is light and airy. It was a long time ago and I have wanted to get some more of this perfume. It is one of my favorite. ",5

332,"Queen of Hearts ...Queen Latifah you have out done yourself, this is one of my favorites. I highly recommend anyone to try this beautiful scent, I love it !",5
332,This perfume surprised me! It’s very mature powdery and has some fruit that smells great in the dry down. It reminds me of Le Baisser du Dragon but lighter. I bought two more bottles!,5
332,"I bought Queen of Hearts on a whim because it was a really good price. I am so glad I did. The “musk” description scared me off at first. When you first spray it, it’s very strong and smells really different almost like a men’s cologne. But once it dries on your skin it takes on an amazing scent that lasts days on your clothes. It’s like a musky vanilla amber scent. It’s definitely not a light scent so don’t spray too much. Can’t really explain it but you should buy it for the price, you won’t be disappointed. ",5
333,I have been using it since almost 18 years...! did not try any other brand after trying this...!,5
333,Swiss Army is definitely a head turner fragrance. I truly love the way that it smells. I believe that a man or woman should always complete their attire with some form of smell good.

333,Swiss Army is a scent I find irresistible on my husband. Great price too. Love treating him with this cologne.,5
333,"Swiss Army Cologne is the best smelling Cologne I have ever had smelled on a man. It smells so good. My Insurance agent came Over one day. I had asked him what Cologne he was wearing.

Try it you will love it. ",5
333,Thank you!!! Really glad I ordered through your website. ,5
334,INSTENSO smells great. Very manly. ,5
334,"I've been using the Intense cologne for a few years now, its a scent that can't be beat. I've had several lady friends that have compliment me on how great it smells!! ",5

335,"I have been using Bijan since 1990. I have tried others, but somehow I always seem to get more compliments with Bijan than any of the others. It also stays with me the whole day. I was travelling one year when it was getting harder and harder to find stores carrying my Bijan. Finally in a small little town in Arkansas, This man was selling Bijan along with other perfumes. He had YOUR email. I bought a bottle with him and when I returned home. I emailed you and began a customer / relationship. I have given your company address to friends and strangers.

335,Being using this perfum for years love it. ,5
335,I use only bijan perfumes.. I started in 1990s with bijan original.

337,Great love it!! Will buy again,5
337,Truth Calvin Klein - the description is accurate. Try this one out on your skin not on paper test. It is a beautiful elegant sent but you will give the sparkle to it - it defines you like no other perfume. I think is is a special luck that it is obtainable at this price. When you wear it: first it distinct because you add your own sent to it and second it appears as a very expensive mystery perfume. Love it.,5
337,It’s one of my favorite,5
337,"Calvin Klein-Truth Beautiful light and fresh smell. Goes on very green, dries down crisp and natural, sophisticated presentation. My new favorite.",5

341,"CARTIER La PANTHERE, by CARTIER This is the first time trying this perfume by Cartier. First off I found it had a heavier scent but very interesting at the same time. As the scent settled on my skin it became an enticing smell that honestly I can't describe but I wanted to keep smelling it. I have to say the scent is enticing enough that I want to keep wearing it, so I guess I like the perfume it is very different from what I would usually wear, as my favourite is Versace Signature. As an afterthought as this perfume is on for a while it becomes more exotic.",5

343,"Aramis cologne. My husband was never a huge fan of colognes, but when I first bought this for him, well over 20 years ago, he was hooked. It is his absolute favourite, and is always on his birthday/Christmas gift request list. ",5
343,"Tuscany, for my confident sexy man. He’s used it for 30 years. ",5
343,"I used Tuscany for 20 years then they changed the formula, worst day ever. Sure would love the old Tuscany back, haven't used it since the change. ",1
343,Tuscany by Aramis is an old school favorite. It still has that excuse me what is the name of that cologne you’re wearing . My reply to question is I can’t tell you because I don’t want anybody to smell like me.,5
343,Tuscany luvit been wearing for over 30yrs since 18yrs old definitely turns heads thank you so much am enjoying the Cologne n will be buying more soon,5

344,"OMG l can't believe how good Wings Cologne smell I'm very happy and blessed to enjoy it. I remember it was in 2010 when someone introduced me that cologne, since of that day we're falling in love thank you to my friend",5

345,Omg let me just say this is my favorite! I got this for my bday trip to Paris... so many compliments & lasts all day! I’m not even halfway done with my first bottle & I will be ordering a 2nd bottle. The prices on here is amazing btw wow,5

346,"I discovered Number one a few years ago when my roommate moved out and left a bunch of junk behind, including a full bottle of this. I decided to try it and got a ton of compliments. So I've been buying it since. The delivery came waaaaay earlier than expected, so it was a good surprise when i got home. The wife loves it.",5
346,It’s not bad but don’t last long at all. It’s sweet too all the reviews are over rated . I like Boss but can’t help noting my displeasure. It’s gone way too fast. There are probably better ones. ,3
346,It's an old time favorite. Always get the best of quality. Great website to order all you favorites. ,5
347,Just received it today and it smells great. Not too strong and not to faint. Perfect!!,5
347,Coach Platinum has a smooth caressing smell which is elegant but not feminine. It is of a style which is very common so it does not add to my range of fragrances. It is as good as the others but no better. It highlights the fact that sometimes it is nice to have a unique fragrance.....but this is not it. The bottle is fantastic...bloody fantastic.,5
347,"Received Coach Platinum as a gift to myself and the smell is just fantastic, but I only ordered the 0.25 fl oz to test.",5
347,"Got a chance to smell this juice and I loved it but knew I had something very similar. So if this helps anyone thinking of trying this one,it's veryclose in DNA to Parfumes De Marley's Pegasus. Not quite as much almond in this but it is a milky clean scent. I was that close to getting it but I am trying to slow down on my scent purchases. It does smell fantastic and if you do not own the PDM scent this is a good buy.",5
347,Very impressed don’t know which smells better the regular coach or this one. Great smells I must say. Proud to own both,5
348,"I found My Burberry Black sample in a magazine and fell in love, I couldn’t order it fast enough! I get compliments all the time on how good I smell and asked what I’m wearing..... I highly recommend ordering this long lasting, absolutely deliciously Devine perfume.... you won’t regret it! It’s been my new signature scent for a little over a year now & I just fall more in love with it every time I wear it... which is anytime I go anywhere! ",5
348,One of my favorite perfume. Very satisfied with my purchase and can’t beat the prices on this website. Everything was delivered on time and smell really good. ,5
348,Love this perfume going to order a other one ,5
348,"After watching a YouTube video reviewing My Burberry Black, I HAD to get my hands on it. I raaaaaaarely make any blind purchases when it comes to perfume, but this smells even better than described! It’s a deep, rich, almost masculine scent. If you want to feel dangerously sexy, yet darkly mysterious, this is absolutely for you. I feel like a femme fatale, or like,..... one of those female spies from a Bond movie, lol. I can’t get enough!",5
348,My Burberry Black I really do like this fragrance. Yes I've purchased 4 bottles within a month. I'm giving 2 bottles for Christmad gifts and 2 for myself. Yes I would purchase it again and recommend it to. I receive compliments every time I wear my My Burberry Black.,5
349,This is the quintessential summer scent. It is fine for spring too but definitely not a fall or winter fragrance. It has a very sweet smell but retains plenty of masculinity. It's the perfect blend. I wore it when I was day drinking outside with a girl friend recently and she mentioned half a dozen times how amazing I smelled. This is worth having in your collection for any occasion that involves being outside and having the heat WORK IN YOUR FAVOR. This fragrance easily lasts eight hours and I've had it last even longer than that. I have roughly 25 bottles of fragrances and this one is easily in the top 5 for me. It is an outstanding smell; you just have to make sure you wear it for the right occasions. ,5
349,"1 Mil Lucky!!! A crisp, manly, elegant but not overpowering smell. Sultry but a fresh smell that can be worn at all times day to evening.",5
349,again another over hyped fragrance does not last long and yes i own this its not worth the money and since they dont want to lower the price im giving this one star for misusing the consumer ,1
349,Paco rabbane 1 million lucky is a great long lasting fragrance. It came on time and it smells amazing. My wife loves it on me.,5
349,"I love it, It has a wonderful smell",5
350,I absolutely love this fragrance!,5
350,"I had this given to me Christmas 4 years ago. This fragrance is so feminine, floral but not ovwrpowering. It lasts on me quite a while. It starts bright and floral and finishes sweet and warm. I love this and finally ran out and wanted round 2 with it. ",5
350,Smells good but doesn't last.,1
350,"I love lovestruck and so do my 2 sisters. It is very hard to find it in stores because,we all have looked for it but to no,avail. That is why I decided to go online,to buy it. It smells so good but not over powering. My,sisters fell in love with it too. My very favorite perfume so I hope they do not quit making it!!",5
350,Love struck (Vera wang). I love it. I thought my order took longer being mailed this time but I finally got the perfumes. I like them all. Thank you. Darlene Dusty Mondoro,5
351,"Ordered the vial for Viva La Juicy Rose to try and I wish I would have ordered the big one, it smells amazing. Will be ordering this on my next order. ",5
351,I love Viva La Juicy Rose ! I let my daughter smell the fragrance and now I have to order her a Viva La Juicy Rose for Christmas ! ,5
351,"I've ordered this fragrance for the first time in the Viva La Juicy & it smells wonderful too, so I thought I'd give this one a try as well & judging by the reviews I won't be disappointed? I love the scent, it's not over powering & the scent lasts a long time as well. The trick to keep the scent from fading quickly is not to rub it in, just allow it to dry after applying. Thank-you Fragrance Net for providing designer scents at affordable prices!",5
351,Viva la juicy rose smells beautiful last all day good quality good price l really recommend this perfume l hope they never discotinue this Item .,5
351,"I bought Viva La Juicy Rose’ for my daughter and she loves it. Not only does it smell good, but it has lasting power. I am soo happy with my pick!",5
352,"I have wore Calvin Klein’s truth sense 2002 when released, ive gotten more compliments & asked what i was wearing in any cologne ive ever wore,i it stays with me all day long and wears really well,,thanks Calvin Klein for the truth cologne its sent many many compliments this guys way for many years.",5
352,I personally love the smell of Calvin Klein Truth. The only downside for me is that is doesn't last very long or atleast on me. If it did I would say this is one of my favorites. If it lasted longer I would of rated it five stars.,4
352,"exelent ,fast delivery , and good cologne",5
352,This is by far my favorite cologne. What's incredible is the price I paid for it. The first time I bought Truth it was about $60! Very satisfied with my purchase and will shop here again.,5
352,"Very nice cologne to wear out to a nice, dinner or too a fancy establishment, one of the best colognes ive purchased yet.",5
353,I always buy this for my daughter she is so in love with DNKY products ,5
353,"I love it ! It has such a sweet, fresh smell! This is the Donna Karan Dkny be delicious Fresh Blossom.",5
353,"DKNY Be Delicious, that's my perfume. I love it. I get so many compliments. I tell my girlfriends to try it. But they say it smells better on me then on them. I don't know. One Happy Customer. ❤",5
353,"I ordered this for the first time and I was so nervous because I've never even smelled it before. But I absolutely love it! Fresh Blossom has a fresh, crisp, clean scent. Kind of fruity, makes me want to try the others ",5
353,I have not received the bvlgari variety set. Delicious and cashmere mist were bought as gifts. Delicious is light yet lasting..not irritating to the sinuses. I do not k ow how the cashmere mist is. After my friend gets it i will know.,4
354,"Narciso Rodriguez for HER drives me wild....and I cant tell you what it does for him...(double wink.) I'm pretty pleased with my 1st order with FragranceNET as I am very very very serious about my TOP 3 perfumes. This being #1. I must say it seems authentic.... not a replica. Ill be ordering again and again especially for the great price. Narciso for HER is a real grown and sexy scent....Its sensual but assertive.... if you like to be sweet but commanding you may love it too. I always get a ""oooo what are you wearing!"" when I wear Narciso Rodriguez. I'm thinking Narciso should create their next line for HER and call it ""oooo WAYW""...lol! Thanks FragranceNET for a super sweet deal",5
354,This is my favorite perfume!! Any chance I might be able to reorder the 5 oz bottles again?? It was such a great deal! Thanks. Kate,5
354,Narciso Rodriguez perfume it’s fragrance is amazing. I like it very much. Everybody asked about my perfume’s frangrance.,5
354,I heard about these products while watching an actress on a talk show. Once she said the product name I researched it and fell in love with for her. It soft and sexy. And everybody loves it. Its not loud. Or overpowering love love love it,5
354,"This fragrance is the best fragrance ever. Elegant and clean, is the definition of it can be used at any time. The fragrance is similar to lovely, but this is more refined.",5
355,"I have been using Quorum since 1986! I tried many others. Much expensive cologne ,they all fail. In front of Quorum , how do you know? Ask the ladies ! Wherever I put Quorum on. A lady will approach me to ask about my Cologne ! ",5
355,This was my first bottle of cologne back in 86’. Still gets the job done. It’s a great beginning fragrance/cologne your guys looking to check out something that’s not too expensive. ,5
355,My husband absolutely loves the Quorum cologne. He was surprised to get it in the mail. This cologne is hard to find. My husband's dad used to wear it so it somewhat has a sentimental value. Thank you so much. I will be purchasing perfume for myself. (Si).. ,5
355,Great product Quorum is Service was excellent Will use again in future ,5
355,Quorum--The Ladies just love it.................,5
356,same canoe ive been using for fifty years great as always,5
356,I can’t tell you how many women have asked me what fragrance my husband was wearing when we are out!! I love telling them Canoe!!!,5
356,Great fragrance! Very unique.I am 65 and have been using Canoe since I was 14.,5
356,I purchased a bottle of Canoe by Dana for my husband as a gift for Christmas. I am sure he is going to love it.,5
356,Canoe by Dana I love on my husband. Wearing it he always gets compliments. So happy I found it on your website to keep him smelling great.,5
357,"ARPEGE, as good as ever.",5
357,I have lovey memories of Arpege in the 1980s. I recently brought a tester version of the fragrance and it was horrible. I think it had gone old and rancid. ,1
357,Arpege has stood the test of time. I love it. ,5
357,I gave as a gift. She loved it.,4
357,"Arpege was my mother's favorite perfume and became mine at least 40 years ago. My husband loves it, so I make sure to always have one or two bottle of Arpege around. ",5
358,I bought a bottle of Bill Blass Nude recently.I have been using this product for a number of years .I really enjoy to wear this particular scent as I always receive a multitude of compliments for it. the perfume is fresh and appealing. It is on the floral side but not overbearingly so. It is sort of seductive and mystical.I will purchase this product again. Nude is not that pricy so that makes it even more fun for wearing.I would recommend it to any woman who appreciates a unique but beautiful fragrance.,5
358,Love this fragrance. It is fresh and very light!,5
358,"Bill Blass’s Nude is my favorite fragrance and has been since my first bottle in 1991. It is often compared to other fragrances but to me, it is in a league of its own and can’t be compared to anything else. It is subtle, feminine, green, sweet (but never cloying), classy, classic, and clean - all at the same time. I’ve received many compliments on it over the years. I’ll occasionally “cheat” with other fragrances, but they’re only temporary and I always return to my favorite, Nude. I don’t care for the gourmands, or any of the now popular fragrances that are so strong that they give me a headache. Nude is a fragrance that one needs to get closer to smell on the wearer. Nude is a fragrance that smells like it should cost at least 10x what the average bottle costs now. I absolutely love it and always will. Try it - there’s nothing else like it anywhere! ",5
358,I purchased Nude several years back from a perfume discount store in Tennessee. I really like the gentle smell of It. ,5
358,Bill blass nude is exquisite . Many compliments ,5
359,The men don't smell that much different from the women...that they don't make anymore..I buy the men's..and a lot of females ask me what am I wearing. And those who rember the lady's be saying where did u find that perfume u have on.,5
359,Blv Bvlgari for men Was blown away; excited the senses A wonderful fragrant for men,5
359,"...been wearing this for several years, a couple before I was aware it's for males! I am complimented on this essence still. LOVE IT !",5
359,one of my all time favorites fresh smell,5
359,Bvlgari blv Pour Homme Excellent Fragrance. Got lits of compliments. Highly recommended!!,5
360,"Miami Glow - Jlo I have been buying this perfume since it came out in 2005, and it now is not the same formula. It is manufactured by a different company and does not smell the same. I have purchased it from here, which was where I always did, and a perfume shop. They were both not good. It was always my signature perfume and now I do not like it.",1
360,better then I expected its got a soapy clean scent i could smell it more when I walked out in the sun definitely gives summer vibes the bottle was bigger then I thought it would be I love the packaging I'm gonna keep purchasing this ,5
360,"Miami Glow by Jennifer Lopez smells so pretty, i love it & will purchase again.",5
360,"Based on the reviews it wasn’t the smell I thought it would be. This has a very clean smell to it. It’s like a soapy fresh out of the shower very good smelling shampoo. Definitely smells like something you would wear to the pool, to the lake, or on vacation. I’m 32 years old and when I smell this I get young vibes. Like a 16 year old would wear this. I will wear this on a summer occasion near water but I probably won’t repurchase. ",4
360,Hands down love this perfume. It has such a summer fragrance with a spicy island feel to it. Can't go wrong with this at all. I get multiple compliments about how good I smell. ,5
361,"Love it nice clean scent not too dressy but classy as well I've all the Vince camuto's but this and eterno"" get the most what you wearing dude""""""but man is the best I think ",5
361,Vince Camuto Man is one of my all time favorites. On my 3rd bottle. ,5
361,Vince campito .Perfect! We lvenit,5
361,Fantastic cologne very pleased with this a must add too your collection to remain sharp and putting smiles around the office ,5
361,"Vince Camuto Man is a fresh masculine scent that is perfect for the spring, summer and early fall. It exhibits a luxurious but light musky floral fragrance that will be appreciated by most that are in close proximity to smell the wafting scent. Fragrance lasts about three (3) to four (4) hours. Pair it with Vince Camuto Terra for a killer combination! ",4
362,"I just purchase a bottle of this cologne and the fragrance is absolutely great. I love its masculine scent, project and long lasting sweet woody smell. If you done have a bottle as yet, I would definitely recommend the fragrance its a knock out.",5
362,Came on time with extra shampoo and shower gel. Bvlgari man in black smells so good,5
362,Bvlgari Man in Black EDP Another great fragrance from Bvlgari. Best for an evening out...wink wink nod nod (MPFC).,5
362,"Really happy with this purchase, Bvlgari black is a strong, masculine scent that is long lasting with good projection, happy with my shopping experience too. Thanks guys!",4
362,LOVE IT ..OMG ABOUT TO ORDER A BIG ONE FOR MY HUBBY,5
363,This scent never fails to get compliments. It is very soft and sexy and leaves a beautiful “memory” of you as you brush by causing people to ask what you are wearing. I spray it on every day. It is my signature scent. I absolutely love it. ,5
363,"Love this scent, curious why the price has increased so much??? Too popular now???",5
363,One of my favorites Prada Infusion ❤️,5
363,One sentence. I’m in love with Prada/Iris. I stumbled upon it and immediately got married to it. ,5
363,"I love this fragrant. Ever since my son gifted me a bottle of this , I have been using it ever since. This is for Prada Infusion D'Iris. I hope you continue to carry this.",5
364,"Received a bottle of this a couple of years ago as a Christmas gift. I had never used it before, but found that it’s light and breezy scent became one of my favorites right away. Highly recommended as an everyday scent ",5
364,"This is hands down one of my favorite scents, It is very unoffensive and fresh, can be worn for any ocasion. My problem and reason for 3 stars is that it doesnt last at all. This will at most project for an hour, then my the 3rd hour you will barely even be able to smell it on yourself. Soon after it will be completely gone. This needs an intense version.",3
364,Got a sample of this loved it ever since smelling it in the store. Been thinking about getting it,5
364,"Has a very clean scent, very subtle. Won't offend anyone.",4
364,"Boss Bottled Tonic is a nice clean fragrance. Is not Hugo Boss best cologne, but is good enough. Is good to wear at work, or if you are doing errands. It doesn't have the ""wow"" factor. I need to apply at least 4 sprays, because it's light. In summary, Boss Bottled Tonic is good, but there are a lot better out there.",4
365,Samsara. Had to order. It has been one of my favorites since 1987.,5
365,"Samsara by Guerlain is really a new twist on refreshing and not overpowering. I love oriental scents, the woodsy scents and this is all blended with a touch of light floral and vanilla. It's just right for the upcoming warm summer months, not heavy, and a wonderful scent. I would recommend this to any woman who likes woodsy and light floral.",5
365,"I LOVE SAMSARA !!!!! After Victoria Secret discontinued their ""Encounter"" perfume, I was forced to find a new scent. Though it took me many years to find a replacement, I eventually came across Samsara and have been receiving compliments every since. I judge my choices by others responses. Of course I must approve of the scent first, but I feel that if others really like it, it is the best scent for me!! ",5
365,I love Samsara. I particularly like the body cream which is next to impossible to find much my dismay. ,5
365,"I’m very happy with Samsara perfume and have worn it for years. It is my signature scent. I love Champs Elysses also. It’s so light and makes me feel beautiful when I wear it. Years ago I wore Shalimar. I’ve never experienced a Guerlain product I didn’t love. Thank you, Guerlain. Genie ",5
366,"Love it, it is the only cologne I wear.. Sue Higginbotham",5
366,I've been wearing tea rose for years. Love it! I still get compliments on it!,5
366,"Love it, pure Rose scent. Perfect for my daily use. ",4
366,Love it! My daughter originally bought it for my birthday. Now it is my favorite scent,5
366,This is my signature perfume. I have worn it for over 25 years. I am constantly asked what are you wearing. I have asthma and cannot stand heavy smells. Tea Rose is subtle and so lovely.,5
367,"Yacht man blue, my son loves it the smell last for a long time & it’s just a fresh summer scent kind of puts you in the mind of cool water definitely a must have for the price definitely will be buying again I’m giving 4 stars because it smells better than a lot of colognes that cost double its price ",4
367,My first time trying yacht man blue. I didn't wear it yet for I have lots of cologne but the smell is good. I can def see me wearing this on a nice spring summer day. It reminds me of a stronger Tommy Hilfiger cologne from back in the 90s.,4
367,Man Great scent for the price just can't beat it give it 4.5 out of 5 stars ,4
367,Bought this for my husband and he loves it!!,4
367,I wish it was strong n last long,3
368,"I bought this with regular price, but I got a product with broken box and not seal, like used product...",1
368,"Lacoste Pour Homme is a really pleasing scent. It's in the same category as Versace Eros, in my opinion. But different enough that you don't feel like you're wearing the same scent. Great option if you want something different, but still want the similar type of scent. Longevity was about 5-6 hours on my skin and about 1 hour projection before it felt more of a skin scent. ",4
368,I love the smell and have gotten many compliments.,5
368,1 of favorite colognes ever!! I have been wearing this cologne for years now and always find myself coming back to Lacoste Pour Homme.,5
368,"My step dad had this cologne back in the day and remembered how much I liked it. I have bought him almost every Lacoste cologne available but I liked this one the best. Now that I am older I decided to add this cologne to my collection. At the price available with with additional 33% off from the website, it was a steal, highly recommend ",5
369,LOVE the scent of this cologne.,5
369,Just recently received as a present and glad I did. Nice long lasting fragrance. ,4
369,Clean fruit/spice scent for any season. ,5
369,Smell is amazing an very quick delivery,5
369,Brit Rythm is a more subtle scent for Burberry. It is perfect for night and close encounters. The subtle note of leather stands out and leaves a relaxed feeling. ,5
370,This is a classic for me first used in '87 and has been in and out of my rotation ever since. I ordered it from you guys because I thought the value for the tester was worth it. Wore it to work the other day and it elicited many compliments,4
370,Great stuff! Light but intense ,5
370,"My brother gave the cologne to me 20 years ago, and It's the only cologne I wear on a consistence basic. Whenever I have it on, I am, complimented ! ",5
370,"I don’t believe that it smells lemony, it smells like pine trees, amber, and it has a warm feeling when you smell it, I got it as a Christmas gift from my mother, so it kind of smells like christmas to me, it is very strong, but in a good way, if you buy it I am sure you will love it, I know Versace L’homme is one of my favorites",5
370,This is a acquired taste compared to the new Versace fragrances I am a big fan so I had to add it to my collection!,2
371,"I love it’s light but long lasting fragrance it is one of my summer time favorites, but this one was a gift",5
371,I just love this scent. This is the first time I’ve ever tried Jadore and certainly won’t be the last. All I can say is it just lifts my mood...the scent is truly lovely.,5
371,"This perfume is amazing and for an eau de toilette has incredible silage and longevity. J'Adore EDT was formerly known as J'Adore Lumiere. Dior discontinued regular J'Adore EDT and gave Lumiere that honor, which is fitting as Lumiere is a much better fragrance. Like it's former name, J'Adore is luminous. It absolutely sparkles like the finest champagne. You will feel wonderful and get noticed wearing this scent. It is breathtakingly beautiful!",5
371,A definite go to for females! Very feminine smell!,5
371,"J’adore is a subtle, lingering, beautiful scent. It does not overpower, and lasts even longer when layered with the bath gel.",5

372,"Purchased Hugo Boss Deep Red. Could not find locally so ordered on line and received today. I sprayed to check if the scent was correct and YES it is. Love it! Will order from this company again, great service",5
372,Hugo Red Boss has been my favorite for years. I had a boyfriend like 20 years ago that bought me a bottle and I’ve been wearing it ever since. Then I couldn’t find it anymore and wore other kind but never could find the scent I liked. And I tried lots of expensive perfumes and never found one I liked. I was so excited when I found your website. I was so excited to see that you had my favorite perfume. I bought 2 bottles and just Love Love Love my perfume!!! It got delivered in a timely matter.

373,"I have been using British Sterling products (aftershave & cologne) for over thirty years. So many other brands are overbearing where B.S. products are pleasant and easy on the senses. I've even had several people compliment me by asking ""what is that good smelling stuff you have on""? ",5

374,"I have used Jean Nate After Bath Splash since the 1950's. I recently purchased Jean Nate After Bath Splash and was disappointed. It does not have the same fresh citrus scent as my old bottle from several years ago. When I compared the two bottles, I noticed that the new Jean Nate has added moisturizers, which might be why the scent is not the same. After having tried the new Jean Nate several times, I can not stand the scent and will no longer be using it. Also, I wish that Jean Nate Cologne was for sale again. It was lovely.",2
374,"Love, love jean nate,wish you had the powder and cologne",5
374,"Love to use Jean Nate after getting out of the bath or shower. I have used it for years and buy it for myself and my mom, she loves it to. Great scent to wear to bed at night. Smells fresh and clean. Even though it’s been around for years it dosent smell like an old after bath splash. Just nice and clean smelling.",5
374,"I love Jean Nate! I first used it in about 1964, or '65 when my MIL gave it to me. I've loved it ever since and was afraid it may no longer be available until I found it on your site a few years ago, and have now ordered it again. It's such a fresh and happy scent.",5

375,"Hei was a good buy, When I first opened my box I got the bottle with no cap. Right away I judge it, and boy was I wrong. This cologne smells really good. And i tends to stay a little longer than some of the other colognes I’ve bought. For what I paid for I’d been keeping this one in my colection. ",5
375,"Hei by Alfred Sung, is a beautiful cologne EDT, it has a very clean smell that can be used in the mornings and during the entire day time, I highly recommend it for those who like clean fresh scent than the spicy ones.",5
375,Excellent fragrance lasts all day,5
375,We love Hei! Best scent for a man ever. Have ordered this many times and will continue.,5
376,When i ordered this i had never smelled it..i just knew i liked the notes it displayed..now its one of my go to's for any occasion!! I love it and regret not ordering the biggest bottle!!,5

378,"Ari by Ariana grande was very disappointing to me. I was excited to try it but definitely not smelling like I thought it would! It smelled very strong on me and I only dabbed on my wrist, and the scent on my chemistry made me think of antibacterial hand sanitizer :( I tried letting it dry and waiting to see it my opinion would change on it... nope I had to wash it off 30 minutes later cus it was distracting to me with how unpleasant it was.",1
378,"Smell great on my wife, I love when she walk pass me and her smell stay in the air ....",5

379,"I have been using Very Irrestible for over 12 years! I continue to get stopped in stores and in the mall by people (men too) wanting to know what I have on. The original has a light not to sweet smell, and stays on a long time. I have 4 of the other scents in it, but I prefer the original. Last I priced it at Dillard's and Macy's it was $80.00 +. I have been buying it from here for several years with no issue ever. I prefer the eu de toilette to the perfume because it seems to stay longer than the perfume on me. I have referred this site to several people and all are as thrilled with this site as I continue to be.",5
379,"Very Irresistible perfume is the best scent I have had, loving it everyday.",5

381,Nice cologne to add to my collection. ,5
382,"By nature I am not a florally scent person. This was the first floral perfume I bought when it was released in 2006. I thought it was created by Liz Claiborne, but I could be wrong. The fragrance is warm, inviting, and comfortable. I feel like it is better suited for cooler months, when warmth and comfort are sought for. However, it can also be worn in the evening, for similar effect with an exotic and alluring flare. The amber and musk give it a sensual base while jasmine and peony stimulate your senses; and the silage is alluring without being demanding. If you are normally a warm woodsy scent wearer and are looking to try something new without going too far out of your comfort zone, look no further. You will not be disappointed in your choice. ",5
382,Lucky Number 6 is a nice smelling perfume. I'm just now getting this perfume again. It's been over ten years since I have worn this. So thank you.,4
382,This is a nice oriental smell with notes of floral and spice..very pleased!,4

382,Very nice. Light fragnance,4
383,I love this perfume! I discovered it while shopping at one of your stores and have continued to order it online for the last 20 years! It is subtle but people always ask what I am wearing. When I tell them the name they are surprised by it but tell me they love the scent,5
383,Halloween por Jesus del Pozo. M encanta este perfume y a mi novio tmbn. El tamaño es bueno y m llego rapidito y en excelentes condiciones.,5
383,"Halloween by J. Del Pozo is a great fragrance for everyday wear. It is not overbearing and strong. It smells so clean and fresh. I work with children and never had a complaint about allergies, etc. In fact, students tell me “how good” I smell all the time. I highly recommend this scent. ",5
383,I love this fragrance!!!!!! I have warn it for a while now and I get so many compliments on it. It has become my signature fragrance. ,5

384,"Unfortunately the 1.7oz I receive is the new Miss Dior, not the Miss Dior Cherie in 2005. Still smell good, just not as elegant as Cherie.",2
384,Too floral...too strong...not for me,1
384," Miss Dior is my favorite of all fragrances. A friend presented Miss Dior to me over 50 years ago and of all the perfumes I have worn, Miss Dior is still the closest to who I am at age 83. Thank you for continuing to manufacture the great MISS DIOR. Elizabeth Calden-Smith Murfreesboro, TN",5
384,"Miss Dior cherry, I LOVET !!",5
385,Love Obsession! Long time classic! The Bosy Spray is a nice addition,5
385,Obsession spray only adds to the longevity of the fragrance for a full day of activity. My Husband always receives great compliments on this product. And as always you can't buy this product at these prices anywhere.,5
385,"What a scent!! I bought this and a nice shirt for my granddaughter's high school sweetheart. He loved it and she did too. It really has an unforgettable aroma! Men's Obsession Body Spray is that extra little ""something else"" for a gift bag. They will surely be pleased.",5
385,The only problem they do not have a lot in stock.,5
385,Nice fragrance. Fresh scent with easy body spray application!,5
386,I love the Polo blue eau de parfum. I stumbled across it searching for a birthday present for my son and not only did I get him a kit of it but I then purchased a 6.7oz. bottle of it for myself. It's refreshing and a clean new scent. I'm surprised it's been out this long without me getting some sooner. Thank you Ralph Lauren. ,5
386,"Skip this one. Smells good after the first spray with a fresh, woody earthy vibe. However, it becomes a skin scent within the first hour for me and barely projects off of my skin before that. Have increased the sprays over the last few wears but to no avail. I can barely smell this scent on me...no where near EDP performance. 5/10",2
386,Omg I love this smell on my husband he’s gone through 3 bottles and continues to purchase it. It was a Father’s Day gift and I made him do the switch he was using Eternity.,5
386,"Purchased Polo Blue EDP and I love it! More refined than the EDT version. If you're looking for a fresh with more to it than the usual and masculine, this is for you. Seems like an arm length scent with sillage but a very good one. Can be worn by any age group but better suited for 25 and up.",5
386,I love it I have no complaints except maybe that it's too common but that's not a complaint on the scent itself it's a complaint on society,5
387,Awesome fragrance and super price!!!!,5
387,Does not last long. Maybe a couple hours. Red for Men,2
387,i JUST RECEIVED MY RED FOR MEN SO I HAVEN'T TRIED IT YET. FROM FIRST SAMPLE IT SEEMED A LITTLE SWEET BUT I WILL TRY IT SOON AND COMMENT. MY SISTER HAS USED RED FOR YEARS SO I WAS CURIOUS TO FIND OUT THE MEN'S VERSION.,3
387,Longer lasting!I love it.,5
387,"My son has been wearing Giorgio Beverley Hills Red probably within a year or so since it’s release. He enjoys so much wearing it. He says, and l quote ‘it starts my day perfectly’",5
388,I purchased this product for my sister for Christmas. She absolutely loves Red Door powder and it's very hard to find for a reasonable price any other time of the year. Fragrance Net offers really good deals! ,5
388,"I have used Red Door for several years because I get so many compliments from people, I also used the body powder which I love after a shower. I would highly recommend the perfume and the body powder, you won't be sorry!",5
388,"The Red Door powder is delicious. Always usd Red Door but never tried the powder. I put it on after my shower, and I can smell it all night long. A definite rebuy!",5
388,I use the fragrance in all of it 's splender. I searched for several years until I found your site. I had a difficult time finding the shower gel. I hope you never dc it. I'll feel so bad. It wakes me in the morning and before I leave for chores or work for the day I spray a last spritz or apply the cream to my arms and hands and off I go. This has been going on since college days and I am now 72years old!,5
388,I have used Red Door for about twenty five years now. I use the perfume and body powder and always gets loads of compliments from men. Lots of men want to know what scent that I am wearing because they want to buy for their wife.,5

Wonderful if one wants to creat a new signature scent as this parfum is easy to wear night or day, not too strong for the office. So happy I found Dolce, and have added it to my favorites list. Absolute beautiful bottle, it will look gorgeous on your dresser. ",5
390,I just ordered Dolce on Monday. This will be my second bottle. I absolutely love it. The fragrance is so light. I went for years not wearing perfume because everything I tried smelled horrible on me. And I'm talking about some expensive perfumes. Now I have found something that smells wonderful on me!!! ,5
390,The fragrance is soft and subtle. I received the biggest compliment from my girlfriend as I walked past in her in church. You know if any woman gives you a compliment its good. ,5

Its pretty much been my signature scent since and I don't know anyone else that wears it! I get many compliments and like many of the reviews I've read, men seem to love it! ",5
392,"I encountered this gorgeous fragrance (Laila) while at the Norway Pavilion at Walt Disney World several years ago. The smell was so light & fresh and I immediately fell in love with it...so did my husband!! :) Since that time, so many people have asked me what the fragrance is & where to purchase. People tell me they like it because it smells so soft & not overwhelming. (A lot of men want to know so they can get it for their wife/significant other) This past March, while at Disney, I met no other that GEIR NESS!!!!! He was SO kind & welcoming and shared with me the story of how Laila was developed. I will continue to purchase Laila & have even placed my order for my husband the Geir cologne!! Thank you Geir for sharing this amazing product with the world!!",5

393,"Thunderstorm is by far my favorite oil. The Cologne spray scent lasts longer than the oil. Rain & Salt Air essential oils is a very beautiful scent reminding me of swimming in the ocean at Marina Peninsula, Marina del Rey, Ca. A must try.",5
394,"This is the only Perfume I wear (BVLGARI OMNIA)!!!!! It is both sexy and romantic at the same time and matches well with my skin ora.

394,BVLGARI OMNIA.. This is different than any kind of perfume I have tried. Reminds me a bit of Versace crystal noir which I like. I didnt know about this perfume at first. Kind of woodsy but after the dry down its a nice earthy subtle scent.,4

395,This scent is liquid sin. It is now my favorite of my whole collection.,5
395,"Creed Royal Oud. Ok, it is simply the best signature scent for me. I have been a loyal Creed Aventis fan until I tried Royal Oud. I am not taking anything away from Aventis but everyone is wearing it now soooooo.... Both women and men stop me to ask ""what are you wearing?"" whenever I wear Royal Oud. It is fantastic in a business setting which is most of the day for me in my line of work. I often transition from the office to cocktails or dinner for business and Royal Oud is the perfect scent for the transition. I am a big fan. I keep two bottles at all times. ",5
395,Tried a vial of creed royal oud just to see what it was about. Loved so I purchased a bottle. This scent puts you in a new dimension lol there's nothing that compares or smells similar to this fragrance. Compliments on top of compliments. ,5

So glad for the Internet as I never see it in the stores any longer, but can now buy online. Always a great and easy gift from my kids... they know that this is the only fragrance I use.

398,"Woman by Ralph Lauren is one of the best fragrances ever---only problem is that the scent lasts but an hour at best. If only it would last! I will not spend the kind of money on a product that they are asking, only to have it disappear so quickly. I would give it a definite 5 Star on the scent and 1 Star on the longevity of the scent. Several on line reviews say this same thing. ",3

401,"can easily see why this fragrance is so popular. One of the nicest ones I've ever smelled. Lasts forever on clothes but mediocre performance on my skin. I'm not sure why but no fragrance lasts that long on my skin. When people say they can smell fragrances after 8 hours, i don't even know how that's possible. After 8 hours, i have to literally touch my nose to my skin in order to smell any fragrance i sprayed there. The best performing fragrance i've ever tried was amouage reflection man. It's the only one that lasted for hours and hours longer than anything else i've ever worn. To me it's a decently unique smell with nothing i own smelling anything like it. Although I've read that it smells a bit like bleu de chanel. But i don't own that one so I can't confirm. Sauvage EDP works great for every day out and about use or office/work use imo.",4
401,"If you want to really knock it out of the ballpark with your wife, girlfriend, and the ladies, get the eau de parfum and not the eau de toilet. The parfum is more intense and lasts A LOT longer. In addition to spraying it on your neck and cheeks, spray behind each ear. It's worth the price! Remember that perfume has a shelf life...use it up within a year or two at the longest. But with Sauvage, it won't last the year!...you (as well as the ladies) will love it. I've gotten lots of compliments at work and when I'm out and about. I like it so much, I've put the cost in my budget every six months.",5
401,I am using Sauvage EDT and i get a lot of compliment at work. I work on oil field and when my boss pass around me. He just say you are dirty but still smell good. I want to get home and buy my self a Sauvage EDP i think i will get double of compliment,5
401,"Great, long-lasting fragrance! Perfect for a go-to work cologne. I tried the trial size vial of Dior Sauvage and was met with many a compliments from my girlfriend as well as the ladies and gentlemen I work with. I sprayed 3 sprays on before I left the house and still maintained a good 2 feet of projection coming home 8 hours later. I highly recommend trying it out.",4
401,"One of the best colognes I could’ve chose. I get many compliments. Is a little pricey, but is definitely worth it, and it lasts long enough. It has a very sexy smell on men.",5
402,This fragrance is very nice. I have allergies and it didn’t bother them at all. Very soft ,5

406,"My sister bought this perfume from another site and I searched for a better price so I purchased it from here. It smells divine. An elegant floral fragrance that is not overpowering. Can be worn at work or for a night out. To me, it's very sophisticated and glamourous. It kinda reminds me of Avon's Little Black Dress. If you loved that one, you'll love this one. ",5
406,Boucheron Place Vendome is the only perfume I wear - I love it! I'm so happy that I found Fragrancenet. This perfume is soooo expensive from the department stores.,5
406,This is my first time wearing this product and I am so in love with it ,5
406,"I love the scent! It’s elegant and powerful, and perhaps should be worn better for cold fall days than for summer. I’m so glad I’ve bought this perfume! ",5
406,A little strong for me should only be worn at night I love ,3
407,"Just got a bottle of Giorgio Beverly Hills... this is Ron Jeremy's scent. Seriously, this oozes 80's, Magnum PI, Porno and drug fueled orgies. Dry down is pleasant, a little goes a long way, you can easily overpower someone with too many sprays. This is a man's fragrance. Very nice in deed!",5
407,"I was shocked to see Georgio for men back. I did not know it and have been so disappointed that it was no longer avilable, but when I saw it on your website, I had to order it. It's one of my favorite colognes for men and I sure hope it stays on the market. Love it. So pleased. Barry J. Kughn",5
407,I was really glad to hear that they brought Giorgio back. This reminds me of my high school days!!! I definitely had to purchase a bottle. I’ll keep buying it when I run out.,5
407,"Awesome fragrance I have enjoyed it for many years, My wife loves it when I have it on! Please never stop making it!!!!!! Giorgio for Men!!!",5

408," exact same thing as the designer stores .......BUT......much more affordable.. thank you. also getting more difficult to find, and my husband has been wearing jovan for a very long time",5
408,Been using Jovan Musk Aftershave since 1974. Have many other products of various brands that just gather dust from none use. The ladies like it a bunch.,5
408,"When my husband & I have been together since 1989 & when I liked the women’s Jovon I loved it I wonder what the Mens colon smells like, I really loved it, I bought it for my husband & he liked it & he had never used anything thing since! He won’t use anything else ",5
408,Really like my jovan musk aftershave. I have been using it for years.,5
408,Excellent for any event or special time to impress!!!!!!!!!,5
409,"I had this but ran out. I loved the scent because it was not overbearing and I like the light notes it carried and blended beautifully. I have never found another that could compare.I got so many compliments when I wore this parfum. I don't wear perfume often as it can get overwhelming. Ladies limit the amount you wear! Trust me, less is best. I can't wait to get another bottle of the Very Hollywood by Michael Kors. ",5
409,"Is very good, nice aromas, perfect for a gift and good prices, definitely recommend for everyone. ",5
409,"Michael Kors very Hollywood, is the next best perfume I have had in awhile. It's very versatile and is great for any occasion and suited for any age-whether young women to those who are more experienced in life. I love wearing this fragrance and the scent is beautifully balanced. ",5
409,"I first tried this scent from Michael Kors two years ago and cannot find another one I like any better. It is definitely for the more mature woman (30+), but it is not over-powering and it lasts all day. Great Buy!",5
409,Micheal Kors Very Hollywood is #1 fragrance out of the 10 fragrances that I wear. I love it please don't stop carrying it.,5

410,Touch is the only perfume that i get the most compliments on from both men & women! I’ve wore it since the early 90’s still to this day it’s my favorite by far! ❤️,5
410,"a friend introduced me to Touch several years ago. Touch is the only fragrance I wear now. People always compliment me, and ask what fragrance are you wearing. Touch will be my forever fragrance. ",5
410,I love touch I wear it to work as well as on special occasions. I wore this fragrance on a cruise and when I got on the elevator one lady came up to me and asked me what I was wearing she said it smelled very fresh and clean. She asked me the name I told her it was touch and she said I have to buy it when I get back home.,5

411,"I have been using Pink Sugar for years and love it. I can't count how many people have come up to me and asked ""what is the name of your perfume"" or it smells like cotton candy is that you? Great product for the money. You won't be disappointed .",5
411,"I love this Pink Sugar roll on. There was a lady I met while I was shopping and she smelled so good. I just had to ask her what she was wearing and she told me Pink Sugar. I just knew I had to buy it, and I am so glad that I did.",5
411,"I am reviewing the PINK SUGAR SPRAY PERFUME FOR HAIR. But a picture of the shimmering roll on perfume is showing. That said, I love the spray perfume for my hair. (This is not a hairspray). I usually spray some perfume on my hair anyway and now Pink Sugar gave me a separate bottle for my hair. I cannot stress enough even if you have never used sweet perfume, as I never did before , you must try PINK SUGAR. You won't be disappointed!!",5
411,Pink sugar women hair spray. Its long lasting and the scent is is just perfect. ,5
412,My granddaughters loved both Katy Perry perfumes that I bought.,5
412,"PURR for Women EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY VIAL ON CARD by Katy Perry Item# 222246 Just using it as a collection item. I like it a lot, just what I was looking for.",5
412,Pleasant but I wouldn't buy a bottle for myself.,3
412,Love it Beautiful unique ,5
412,It's a nice smelling perfume but it's very fair. Honestly it could battle a body spray for longevity. It's a spray and disappear. This is typical for berry fragrances. To make it last longer is to spray a vanilla perfume then spray purr. It will at least keep the dry down longer. Price wise Katy Perry should think about making 3.4oz 9.99 and boost 6oz to 10 oz. For $20 - $25,3
413,"check this out , you may think iam not so smart. However I used this vanilla musk and mask it with Drakkar Noir just to see if anyone would ask me what I have on and yes four lady ask me what is the name of the cologne I'm wearing my respond was I can't remember and they all said I smell so fresh.. P.S. I'm the type of person that always put 2 different types of cologne on just because. ",5
413,"A friend introduced me to Vanilla Musk some years ago and I am so glad I can buy it here. I haven't found any other perfume that makes me smell so great. It doesn't matter what your age is,it is a timeless yet affordable fragrance and if you're lucky,you'll be sure to get some positive comments about it. It's happened to me so,maybe it'll happen for you. Try it.",5
413,LOVE THIS PERFUME vanilla musk I would wear it all the time Vanilla is my favorite Going to get myself a bottle Wish they had a bigger bottle ,5
413,Love it! Vanilla is my favorite smell. I have used this cologne for years.,5
413,"Vanilla musk is the ideal fragrance for my teenage niece. She's one of four junior bridesmaids for an upcoming Christmas wedding & she needed a nice scent for the occasion. In reading Linda Salerno's review I thought hmm,perhaps I'll give it a try. I swear I heard angels singing, because it smells so heavenly!! I'm so happy for this discovery that I bought five bottles. I then showed it to my niece & not surprisingly she loved it very much,so two for her & three for me. Thank you Linda and Coty for this fantastic fragrance. Am I a cool aunt or what? ",5
414,Light and airy. Lasts long. Get compliments all the time. My new favorite ,5

414,Love this fragrance so much!,5
414,Amazing fragrance! Sort of reminds me of Dolce Light Blue.. great for everyday use or evening on the town! I love perfumes of all kind and I always go back to this beautiful scent ,5

415,Love it !! Definitely will buy it again ,4
415,Burberry The Beat is a fragrance I have owned for years. I finally found it on your fragrance line thank you.....100% satisfied ,5
415,"This is a delicious, fruit scented perfume that will last through the day. I purchased the vial spray...as I do with any new fragrance to sample...and I'm upset at myself for not getting the 3.3 ounce bottle! I actually like this scent...even with the sweet tones...and it's not over bearing at all. I get compliments at work...and I work in a hospital where it's hard to wear hard scented perfumes due to allergies and sensitivity. My advice...if you are skeptical, buy a vial spray but if you do get a bigger bottle, you will NOT be disappointed!",4
415, smell so good. ,4
416,A friend of mine got me thr Burberry weekend in 2007 an from that day until now am using it i just can't get over it it's too good to be true thanks Burberry weekend ,5
416,I've been purchasing this cologne for my husband for years. He loves it and I do too. Both of my sons have tried it and it smells slightly different on them. They both really like it as well. It is nice that a product can be counted on for consistent usage. Thank you for a wonderful product.,5
416,"Lemon or Tangerine scent it smells So good, Its not Feminine, Its good real good! For the man in your life!",5
416,"Light scent, almost too light. Seems almost weak,...No pun intended May be something to wear after a shower, before sleep.",1
416,"I received my order in quick time, was very surprised too. My Weekend Burberry is one of my favorites.... Smell so great.. Thank you.. fragrance net.",1
417,I looooooove this Jimmy Choo Fever fragrance. I smelled it in Macy’s and just knew that I had to get it ❤️ My absolute favorite!!,5
417,"Jimmy Choo's FEVER is great! Like the oriental touches, not heavy and has a staying quality that doesn't disappear a short period of time.",5
417,I loved the smell of Jimmy Choo Fever on paper but on me...it's real bad. I'm returning it asap. Wore it once and hate it. ,1
417,Jimmy choo fever has an amazing warm scent. I love it so much ,5
417,I looooove this SEXY feminine scent. It is so soft yet elegant. This is my favorite Jimmy Choo scent and hope they will continue making this forever!!!!! I always get compliments!! Especially from my husband!!,5
418,I've been using this since 1999 and it still gets me many compliments from guys and women. It has a lasting smell that will remind the one you love of your presence days after you're gone. Worth the investment hands down. Can't wait to purchase more.,5
418,I bought Polo Sport years ago when they had a Special going by a Polo Prod. and get a set of 3 Bears. I had a friend who was battling Breast Cancer. Sent her the Bears they were a Smash. But as it goes She was taken. Polo Sport for me is to Remember ROSE by.,5
418,This is an amazing product I've been using it for over 20 years and the compliments are never ending out of five stars I would definitely give it a 10,5

419,"It's a sweet smelling perfume as the name suggests, the smell stays close to the skin so you'll still smell it on your clothes if u try to sniff after a day at work or so. nice smell but the projection and sillage is weak. I wear it casually. I've only got one compliment on it. I've had it for a year.",3
419,I love how the bottle looks and how it smells. It smells sweet like candy. I’m not even done with it and I want more lol,5
419,Sweet like Candy smells Great! It's not to strong. It stays with you all day. I Love to smell Sweet all day!,5
419,Love love loveeeee thisss omggggg it smells sooooo beautiful!!! Highly recommend it! ,5
420,"Can Can is my go to. It has been my daily wear for years. Wherever I am, men, women and children tell me I smell so good. A little old guy approached me in the Market and said, Uh, Miss, I don’t mean any harm, but I just wanted you to know you smell so beautiful...and you look beautiful, too. I thanked him, and he left smiling. I also have the Shower Wash, Mist and Lotion. Fantastic fragrance. ",5
420,"Can Can is a wonderful scent,I'm very surprised at the compliments I got on this one. I honestly had my doubts in the beginning after buying it because of the youthful packaging, but I was wrong,in a good way if I might add. It's very soft,by no means overpowering and has a decent silage. A pity there's no lotion to go with it,but an unscented one can do just fine too. ",5
420,Paris Hilton Can Can has always been a favorite of mine. Love the scent,5
420,It was for my sister and she absolutely loves it.,5
420,I like thos perfume because it's strong enough to smell as you walk by but not too strong that it triggers people's allergies.,5
421,"If you're looking for an inexpensive alternative to bois du portugal, la lique lot homme is definitely one to consider. Smells great & performs well, it's a winner.",5
421,"Lalique eau de parfum Do no like this scent at all. Very musky, overpowering and over all unpleasant to the nostrils. If you do decide to purchase this item spray once and walk away. ",1
421,"Lalique has a very strong, overpowering, musky scent that I did not like. An old man scent that I found offensive. Will not purchase this again.",1

422,I ordered the Amethyst Lemricka I heard it’s wonderful lovely stays all day can’t wait to get it home. Thank you.,5
422,"This is my fragrance! I have been wearing it for years. I have had so many compliments everywhere I go and so many people want me to write down the name! It is wonderfully light, but lasts all day and I have never found anyone to say it is offensive. I use a lot too!! I like to smell my perfume and this one is never too heavy no matter how much you put on and everyone loves it!!",5
422,"Love Lolita Lempicka so very much . Every time I run out I order this one right away . When I wear it everyone says “ Oh woww this smells so good , what is it “ it smells so good and you do not need to put much on , it lasts on you a very long time too so no need to spray on a lot . I recommend it very much .",5
422,"Lolita Lempicka: A little floral, a little sweet, kind of charmingly old-fashioned, but quirky. Doesn’t smell like black licorice, more like a strange but addictive hard candy your great-aunt brought back from Iceland that one time, flavored with unfamiliar botanicals. In fact it smells like what I think Bjork smells like, and what more could you want?",5
422,"I have been wearing Lolita Lempicka for years! I'ts become my fragrance identity. I love this Lolita because I can't smell it on me. It's a fragrance that seems to only deliver a whiff of a scent when you pass by someone. I put it on in the morning and after an 8 hour work shift I will hear comments "" Oh you smell so good, what is your perfume""? Amazing! I work in an operatiing room and a Fragrance in the hospital setting is not encouraged. My nose has a keen sense of smell so I'm very sensitive to smells. This fragrance is perfect for me! and my work area.",5
423,"Love Baby Touch, not strong at all. Fragrance is like a soft musk, very light.",4
423,"Looking for a subtle light scent? Look no further!! I would highly recommend ""Baby Touch"" by Burberry. As many women have an extensive shoe collection, I have one of perfumes. 54 different scents in fact!! ALL purchased through FRAGRANCENET. COM. It's a VERY fresh, light & airy scent. My only disappointment is it's only available as an Edt spray as compared to the perfume spray, which lasts longer. GREAT FOR YOUNG LADIES WHOM ARE BEING ALLOED TO WEAR PERFUMES FOR THEIR FIRST TIME!!! ",4
423,Burberry baby touch is simply lovely. The scent is clean soft and sexy. Not overbearing perfect for all ages. I love it on a summer or spring day. I spray a little after a shower for my nights rest!! Simply lovely fragrance,5
423,"This is a very soft, light and clean fragrance. I really love it, because I suffer with migraines and finding a fragrance is rather difficult. I might find something that works for me and a month or even a week later - it's madness! Shifting weather & season changes affect everything and I'm always giving away bottles of perfume (new/barely used) that I can't take, after one spritz. This will be my fourth time purchasing Burberry Baby Touch - so far so good. I'm very pleased and would recommend it to those with delicate/heightened sensitivities.",5
423,I purchased this perfume about 15 years ago and always got complimented. I ran out and have searched for it ever since but was not able to find it. I love this scent and cant wait to have it in my hands again.,5
424,I love Curious I have worn it for over 10 years now. Great price on here! Always get compliments.,5
424,I love this the scent every since it came out.,4

424,I really kike Curious. It's light and not overpowering. My husband comments that he likes it every time I wear it.,5
424,Curious- love this scent! Wish it lasted longer !,4
425,"I have a 30ml decant of Creed Aventus (2018 batch) and L'Adventure. I have experimented with both, putting the L'Adventure on my left wrist and Aventus on my right. For those of you who say you can't tell them apart, I beg to differ. I find the opening to L'Adventure to be heavier on citrus and no pineapple in the mix at all (unlike Aventus). L'Adventure also has a stronger blast of scent in the opening and project a little more in the first 30 minutes or so. Aventus is more subtle in the opening and sweeter and fruitier. After drying down for 45 minutes, Aventus is the stronger scent. You can start to smell the vanilla mixing with the pinapple with a hint of green apple. It's wonderful. L'Adventure, on the other hand, smells smokier to me and I really don't get the fruitiness and sweetness from it. L'Adventure has solid projection and decent sillage. It also lasts most of the day and that's a good thing since it is a nice scent IMO. On the other hand, to my nose L'Aventure is at best a 70% clone of Aventus, since I can smell similarities at times during the opening a dry down. Maybe it's a 95% copy of an older Aventus batch--but I think most people could easily tell they are not the same fragrance. Still, L'Adventure is a good fragrance in it's own right and it's worth the $35. I might try L'Adventure knight since I like GIT, but not enough to buy a bottle of it. ",4
425,"Smells exactly like armaf club de nuit. It's my substitute wen I can't find that. It's more suitable as a gift for a male who likes to smell expensive(oud) and nice . It's a similar smell to creed . It lasts a bit over 8hrs, but d smell still lingers on the skin. ",5
425,"I am a fragrance nut. Out of all my many fragrances that I try on my girlfriend, L'Aventure by Al Haramain is one of the few that causes her to ask me,"" What is THAT you are wearing?"" She probably thought it was Aventus!",5
425,"L’Aventure. Pretty good copy of a fruity batch of Aventus. Doesn’t last on the skin near as long, and there are some differences. Still, it smells pretty good for what it is.",4
425,L'Venture is a great fragrance. Its the most complimented fragrance I've ever purchased. Definitely get a bang for your buck. ,4
426,"I love this perfume, been wearing it for years, always getting compliments on the way I smell..",5

426,"I have used Provocative Woman for the last 5 years. A lot of perfumes give me headaches, this is one that I found that is pleasant every day to wear, however I'm wondering if I buy the Unboxed or Tester Provocative Woman will it be the same as the Original ?? Thanks, SV",5

427,guilty gucci is fresh ,5
427,It’s a powdery scent but also unique and fresh. Not a compliment monster but it does get compliments. Better for the those close intament moments with a loved one. Doesn’t project for to long and but doesn’t just sit close to the skin it does jump off and linger around.,3
427,I just ordered Gucci Guilty pour homme for my son 24th birthday never smell it read all the reviews and like what i read hope a made a good choice ,1

430,"Just as the write up said. It's a very masculine and clean fragrance, without being too strong or overwhelming. Rod 2/22/20",5
430,The Best kept secret. Wife purchased this for my bitrthday .Amazing Smell...,5
431,I love the men’s so I bought the females for my lady and the both of us love it.,5
431,"Bora Bora, by Liz Claiborne is one of my favorites. Love it!",5
431,Smells very nice lasts maybe 2 hours,3
431,A lady where I worked always smelled delicious wearing Bora Bora so I bought my wife some. Great aroma for both women. ,5
431,Bora bora Liz Claiborne awesome fragrance. Three words I can say love it love it love it. ,5
432,"I love the White Shoulders. It is light and flowery and not overwhelming. I was disappointed with the Joy, but it has been years since I wore it. My chemical makeup could very well have changed over the years. I would not discourage anyone from purchasing. ",5
432,"JOY, the name says it all. For those who compare a fine perfume for a dollar store perfume, it is just a statement, Joy is a perfume that is unique before all these perfumes from celebrities came to the market, Joy was already here. If you buy the Joy on the Caribbean Islands, there is a different tough. The perfume lasts longer and I don't know the reason. If you keep it in the refrigerator and only take it out to use it. it will last until the last drop. Heat affects the perfume. I have a bottle that I bought in Bimini about ten years ago, and it is one ounce of pure perfume, it is more oily than EAU which has alcohol. I get it out put a couple of drops and put it back again. The way it is going it will outlast me without changing the aroma. Yes, Joy is made of flowers, Jasmin, etc. other perfumes have sandalwood and whatnot. But if you enjoy perfume with flowers then this is your perfume. and I give it 10 stars.",5
432,"Joy is a classic floral scent, similar to Channel No9 in fact if you like Channel No 9 you will love Joy. Both these scents are long lasting, have gorgeous notes over time and are my favourites. Joy is suitable for all occasions.",5
432,"I bought this as a gift for my mother and it remained her perfume choice the rest of herlife. She was a frugal woman and carefully rationed her little black bottles, but when she wanted to feel good, there was her Joy. It's a lovely, strong, vintage glory like an explosion of the best old fashioned red roses ever grown. Her only complaint was that the perfume was so realistic and so strong, she couldn't wear it outside without attracting bees and bumblebees, trying to find the source of that wonderful smell! Hope you're wearing Joy in Heaven, Mom. ",5
432,"I first used JOY by Jean Patou at the age of 16 when my boy friend brought it back from Paris as a gift for me. It came in a little black bottle back in 1962 and I fell in love with it. Years after the perfume was all gone, I still kept the little black bottle and box because it still smelled so good. To this day, it is my favorite perfume, and one of a very few that does not affect my breathing as stronger scents do. If you want complements when you wear perfume, this is the one to wear. I highly recommend this perfume! ",5
433,Cool Water for men is very nice. My grandson should like it for Christmas,5
434,Herrera for men is my favorite scent. Great pruce too compared to department store prices. ,5
434,Carolina Hererra for men . I am pleased with the size and the price however the scent seems like it's not the same. ,1
434,I love a light clean scent. And this cologne fits the bill. I wear it day and night. ,1
434,Excellent fragrance as described,5
434,"I am well experienced. Herrera is the 2nd most compliments I have ever received on a scent. The most I have ever on scent is Bel Ami by Hermes at $138.00 for 3,4 ozs.",5
435,"Sean John ""UNFORGIVABLE WOMAN"" Is a beautiful perfume! And the bottle was much larger than I expected, so definitely worth getting! I am extremely pleased with this purchase..Thank You very much",5
435,"I absolutely love Sean Jean's Unforgivable Woman! The scent lingers on you; which I love. I get so many compliments by both men and women. My daughter comes up to me each evening, gives me a hug and say ""you always smell so good"" :-) The cleaning lady at my office says that my office always smells good. Now this is a keeper!",5
435,This scent unforgivable honestly smells like an old lady. It smells nice in the bottle but not on your skin. ,1
435,"Love unforgivable woman by sean John, had some of my best nights with this smell. It is so grown and sexy",5
435,My favorite scent because it is a very distinct fragrance which leaves a tell tell signature that you have been in the room. Every time I wear this fragrance I receive a number of compliments. Best of all my husband and sons love to cuddle up to me every time I wear Unforgivable.,5
436,I had smelled this years ago never bought it. So for my first purchase I went with something i knew I wanted. Love this scent ,5
436,Declaration by Cartier very nice thank you,5
436,"I bought Cartier Declaration because I read a few blogs that said it smelled similar to D&G Masculine which has been discontinued for many years. Man, that is not true. It doesn’t smell atrocious but it also doesn’t smell good either. It is a bit funky and peppery when you first spray it on and I feel the scent goes away rather quickly once you put it on. I don’t recommend this cologne. ",2
436,This is an AMAZING fragrance with superb lasting power. I always receive many compliments when I wear it. This is a very wearable men's fragrance that is PERFECT for a woman!,5

440,"Diesel's Only The Brave delivers a clean refreshing scent that is great for daytime wear, especially when it's warmer outside! Will definitely buy again!!",5
441,This Gucci Floral is by far my favorite scent! It smells very nice and I will be wearing this scent for many years to come!,5
441,I purchased Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia. It arrived in Australia very quickly. It was delivered to my door in a box which contained the item as well as some sample products. Very happy with my purchase and will be recommending this company to my family and friends.,5
441,"This is a lovely floral ,but Elizabeth Taylor is what you're looking for in a gardenia, she improved on her favorite jungle gardenia. Gucci's gardenia floral is a beautiful blend of gardenia and other florals, perfect for a daytime and spring,summer fragrance. I love gardenia and this is a gourmand style of gardenia.",5
441,Really enjoying the Gucci flora gardenia! It’s long lasting but not too overpowering.,5
441,This is one of my favorite scents. The gardenia is not overwhelming. The perfume itself is not as intense as I was afraid a gardenia scent would be. I wear this to the office without worrying I am going to drowned everyone in perfume. Very pleasant! It is one of my signature scents.,5
442,Jimmy choo l eau I'm am not happy with this fragrance at all .the smell gone less than a hour I paid too much to keep this.,1
442,My sister had jimmy choo leau perfume and I loved it she got it at one of those big name department stores but was too pricey for me another sister told me about this web site and the rest is history. Love love love it thanks!,5
442,jimmy choo L’Eau is the other fragance that i realy love,5
442,Jimmy Choo l'eau perfume,4
442,"I bought L'Eau by Jimmy Choo based in some good reviews. I liked the fragrance but actually, I am not crazy about this perfume and I'll never buy it again. The scent disappears within 2 hours! I don't believe that it's worth the money to pay for this fragrance. It's away better to pay a little more money for some decent bottle of perfume that will last at least 5 or 6 hours in our skin.",3
443,"Blind purchase. Love Creed's vetiver so took a leap. Nice scent. I would not say it was mainly by my definition of manly. Dry down reminds me of women's perfume. Smells too much like females and powder - but it is a solid fragrance. Old school, perfect for the office or church, not a date night, exude sex appeal killer, but an elegant, mature fragrance. I like it but not as much as some other purchases. Not like todays scents - which is why I bought it - unique, legit scent!",4
443,"Guerlain Vetiver is one of my favorite late Spring/Summer scents. Unlike many of the uninspired fragrance offerings today, Guerlain Vetiver delivers a distinctively fresh, green, citrusy, lightly smoky, woody aroma that's upscale, masculine, and old-school elegance in a classy, understated way. The sillage trail lingers softly and discreetly with its unforgettable aroma that lingers on the minds of those who encounter it. ",5
443,I have been wearing this cologne for over 40 years. I still get compliments all the time. It turns heads.,5
443,"Guerlain Vetiver is everything that I’d hoped it would be! To my nose, it’s very close to TF Grey Vetiver. Green, vetiver, classy, and a wonderful scent. This has quickly become my new signature scent.",5
443,Vetiver Guerlain is the GO TO cologne for men! It's as old as I am and the only cologne I wear that people compliment every day. It's a must have for professional men that want to smell good all day long. ,5
444,Have been wearing Safari for years. Always get compliments every time I wear it. Over the years I have sometimes had a hard time finding it but not now. I will always order Ralph Loren’s Safari from you. Many thanks. ,5
444,"This is my favorite scent of all time. Ran out years ago and couldn't fine it in any stores. Finally found on this website and was so excited. By the way, this fragrance is the one that I got the most compliments , so needless to say I will reorder every time I run out of it. Chris ",5
444,"When I first smelled This perfume I followed a person into the restroom at the movies and asked her what fragrance she had on and she replied Safari, I asked her who made it and she said Ralph Lauren. I just had to buy it, it was so different from the other perfumes. I just love it. ",5
444,"I was extremely happy to find Safari ,by Ralph Lauren , on Fragrance Net . I have ""ALWAYS"" gotten compliments on how great I smell when I wear it. It had gotten very hard to find. Most big department stores only carry perfumes named after celebraties and a lot of the smaller perfume shops only have counterfeit sents. It's great to find the real thing at an affordable price on Fragrance Net. Thank you so much for that. I wear nothing but Safari now !",5
444,"I am so glad to find my favorite Safari by Ralph Lauren perfume at Fragrance net, it smells so good just the way it smells when purchased at departmental store only cheaper. I love this site and just received another order today.",5
445, This is definitely the scent that I've been looking for!.... perfect for date night and other special occasions.,5
445,"Dior Homme intense is my favourite since 2011, I bought first time in Paris duty free shop, since then if I don't have it on my counter I go crazy ( trust me you will never regret it , if you buy it even blindly)",5
445,"Dior Homme Intense is a fantastic fragrance, well-blended and nicely combines sweet with fresh. I purchased on a blind-buy based upon numerous reviews, and now I am a regular purchaser of DHI for years. A hard fragrance to find in department stores. Great for a date....Great in the Office. ",5
445,The Dior Homme Intense is a wonderful fragrance. I discovered it in Spain two years ago and have used it ever since. Love the intensity of it and the lingering scent which lasts a long time.,5
445,I love this cologne dior intense ,5

446,Nice smell but doesn't last long,2
446,"I love the fresh clean scent of Contradiction, have been wearing this scent for over 10 years now. A real compliment getter. Sometimes it turns into beast mode. And for the price you can't beat it. Last on my skin at least 7 hours and projects for at least 3 hours. ",5
446,Contradiction by Calvin Klein is my favorite product...,5
446, Contradiction by Calvin Klein is a Winner. The Lady's love it. I'm hoping this doesn't get discontinue. Fast shipping and awesome price ,5
447,Blind bought this based off of some reviews I read and was absolutely disappointed. This stuff stinks. The dry down is okay but the opening is unbearable to me. I don't see what the hype is about. I returned it.,1
447,"I'm new to the fragrance game, but this was love at first scent for me. It's refreshing with moderate performance - 4 to 5 hours and I can still smell a hint on my skin. An easy spring/summer office reach for me and carry a decant to refresh as needed.",5
447,"I love it, it came very quick was shocked it came so fast. Product smells masculine & lovely ",5
447,"The smell is super amazing,the price is wonderful,shipping always fast. i order this fragrance and i got an empty bottle,i called and the customer service was very fantastic,they took care of my return and sent me an other bottle within 2 weeks. Thank you guys,please keep up with the hard work satisfying your customers.",5
447,"Absolutely love it, it’s long lasting an the projection is great. ",5
448,Think of it as Stetson mixed with Dolce Gabbana The One and a little extra spice thrown in - It's incredible and is in the same playing field as the big dogs! Never again will I cast aside a 'car' fragrance.,5
448,"Very nice fragrance, very good smell, longevity 2hr.",3
448,Bentley for men intense is great fragrance for men’s ,5
448,"Bentley Intense....Excellent fragrance, ravishing!",5

Love, love, love this perfume. I am in my 80s but still keep a 3 bottle supply at all times to make sure I don't run out!!! My 30+ granddaughter in Florida says she still turns around in public expecting to see her Nana (me) when she smells this fragrance. I will NEVER, EVER wear any other perfume other than Herrera!! Total strangers are always asking me what fragrance I wear and I happily tell them. As long as it can be found, I will always wear this fragrance!! ",5
449,"I adore Carolina Herrera, Herrara perfume. Has been one of my signature scents for ages. It dries on you 100% true and lasts all day, you can even detect it the following day. Feminine, classy floral with fresh confident feel. Fab!",5
449,"I have worn Carolina Herrera seems like forever, more over 30 years - I wont wear any other fragrance I always get compliments on how good I smell - it's not overpowering but it carries its own tune it really embraces my own body chemistry. I get compliments all the time I have had people men and women follow me to ask what I was wearing. Its a clean romantic at the same time refreshing fragrance. I like to use the lotion, bath and body oil when I can find it. Its my signature fragrance. I love it ",5

I have several other fragrances on my shelves but this is the one I keep coming back to time and time again. Just a nice, subtle fragrance. Not too old or too young. Not too sweet or powdery or musky or anything. It lasts long and is perfect for my body chemistry. ",5

455,Love Elizabeth Taylor perfume but Gardenia is to light for me it a lovely scent but don't stay with you a long time i think i'll stay with White Diamond i have been using it a long time ,3
455,"When I purchased Elizabeth Taylor's ""Gardenia"" I really didn't have a very high expectation because I'm usually disappointed with most fragrances that I try. I can only wear a few different fragrances that don't make me physically ill. So, to my surprise, I found this fragrance to be simply delightful! The gardenias, along with the blend of the jasmine, lily of the valley, musk, and rose, contributes to such a beautiful scent that I can wear without any problem. I have been stopped several times and asked what I am wearing. Gardenia fulfilled the expectations that I was hoping for (but didn't have), and actually surpassed them! This is my second order, so you know that I am a happy customer! ",5
455,Gardenia Elizabeth Taylor smells very close to a real gardenia. It lasts well after application. Have always had compliments on it by total strangers.,5

It simply smells great. It ideal for office wear. A fresh non offensive fragrance. Some reviewer said it wasn't a long lasting fragance, however in the office it projected about 3hrs, and then got close, but the aroma lasted 12hrs with wofts of pleasantness. I'm extremely pleased with this product.",5

458,"I bought the Eternity for men deodorant for my son. He’s 17 yrs old and he loved it!! My first purchase for him was from Marshall’s and it was the same price as here on FragranceNet. Well, on here, it beats going around looking for it. I can just order and it arrives about a week later. At Macy’s it was about $26. Lol...call me frugal, but that’s too expensive for my blood.",5
458,Jose M Eternity is my brand name product. For years and years I have been getting them from a department store in my area. The product are exactly the same but the prices are way lower here at FragranceNet. ,4

459,"One of my favorite men's cologne ever. Bought for a friend who has used it for years and was almost out. He was thrilled. Cant go wrong with Paul Sebastian. Smells heavenly. (Bought cologne, aftershave and deodorant).",5
459,(Cologne Spray 4OZ and afershave 4 oz) I think I have been using it for over100 years(Actually I am only 81 this coming may 26) but I wouldn't use anything else so don't let the company go out of business. Lou,5

461,"Versace Woman... I’m 34 and bought this unsure if I would like it. Well, I ended up giving it to my mother after I smelled it. Strong musk smell but had some sweet tones once it dried. But the musk really over takes it. ",3
461,VERSACE WOMEN IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE SCENT IT REALLY SMELLS LIGHT AND SEXY BEEN BUYING IT FOR 10 years ,5
461,I absolutely luv this smell it attracts whoever is next to you or passes you. And I luv this website it’s one my favorites. ,5

462,Armaf Tres Nuit is nowhere close to aVentus not even remotely close it smells nothing like it. For some reason my reviews are not displaying.,2
462," Armaf tres nuit Booo... you might as well just buy some alcohol from the drugstore and spray yourself with it,wanted to try this cologne out after reading the reviews on here but the reviews are far from correct does not have any smell at all. Very disappointed.",2
462,Tres Nuit by Armaf is a great performer. Smells very good and last long. It’s definitely gets the compliments !! ,5

462,Amazing scent! 95% clone of Creed green Irish tweed then dry down is 90% cred imperial M. Incredible but I don’t like creed imperial but I still acknowledge this is a great fragrance!,4
463,Ombre Rose was devoid of aroma!!,1
463,"Ombre Rose is terrible! a waste of my money! It even looks big on pictures, but it's way too small and the smell is something else! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!",1
463,"Used this fragrance many years ago. It had a soft, gentle , feminine scent. it was not overpowering at all. That's what I liked about it.",5
463,Ombre Rose. A feminine scent. Not too strong for anyone who wants/needs lighter perfumes. The scent is powdery for those who don't like that. Paired with the light scents is the wood note which makes it an interesting experience the wood note reminds me of incense (but not overpowering). The mini bottle is so pretty uncorking the plastic stopper might be difficult for people with hand mobility issues. The bottle is so narrow I don't dare put it down without the stopper in it as it sometimes falls over when I put it down on a surface. ,5
463,Elegant and alluring. Very feminine. Great for day and evening. Reaps a lots of favourable compliments. Only bought the miniature so will now go back and get a bigger bottle.,5
464,Wonderful Santal Royal. My fav,5
464, Very nice scent wears very well for about 5/6 hours. Several compliments so far,5

465,"Viva La Juicy Glace Very pretty design, fresh and free scent, it makes you feel yourself in your teens, the only disadvantage is short lasting smell. Ideal for teen girls.",4
465,The box and design of the product is SO pretty! Glace smells amazing and it does not mess with my allergies. ,5
465,Viva la juicy glace came broken from FragranceNet But the box smelled pretty. Waiting for a credit to be added back to my credit card.,5
465,The scent smells so nice it's a more fresh Light scent but it does not last as long as I would like for it to last. I would give this fragrance a 3.5 out of 5 because the smell and the packaging are outstanding but the longevity is it's not so good on my skin. Highly recommend for younger girls in their teens.,4
465,I recently ordered the viva la juicy glace perfume as a gift for a friend of mine and she likes it a lot.,5

In the city in which I live here in California I finally found it in one of our upscale department stores. If I could buy it by the case ( smile, I would) I received many compliments when wearing the fragrance, and of course, when asked the name of the fragrance I did get an ribbing because of the name. I took it as a compliment. Well after writing this article I think I will take a trip to the department store tomorrow. Such an unforgettable fragrance. Love, love, love it!",5
475,"I have always loved perfume from sweet to woodsy to generic to my new love Eau Des Mermeilles. A co-worker wears it and I loved it from day one, I just had to find out what it was. So I asked. The next day she brought me in a beautiful little sampler of Hermes and it has been my favorite ever since. On-line now to buy some Elixir! Happy Valentine's Day to me!!!",5
475,"I bought this blind, not knowing how this would smell. I was pleasantly surprised by how this scent dried down to a perfect sweetness with a little sultriness. This is another Hermes scent I love! Elixir des Marveille is a great every day or night out scent. It is very different than most perfumes. It has that rich Hermes feel when wearing this. It is strong at first but dries down in 5 minutes to a scent you and others around you will love...",5
475,"I love this sent. I get so many complements. I only hate when I run low, in that the price is a little dear for 1.6 oz. Oh well it could be worse ;-}",5
475,Elixir Des Merveilles is fabulous. Discovered it when given a sample with another gift. Citursy goodness is what the scent brings to mind. Lifts my spirits anytime I wear it. Loads of compliments,5

476,I have been wearing FIRST for 25 years!!! Now my Daughter wears it and will not wear any other fragrance!!! LOVE IT!!!!,5
476,"First by Van Cleef & Arpels is an aroma no one can duplicate. A few years ago when I l1ived and worked in Bermuda I started wearing FIRST. I never wore it once that someone didn't come up to me and ask me what I was wearing. Now that I have returned to live in Kingston Ontario I have found it difficult to find so I now go on line and order it delivered. I love FIRST - won't wear anything else. If you want to be noticed, wear it and you will be glad you did. Margaret Brady, Kingston, ON Canada ",5

477,I bought it without knowing how it smells I have to say I was a little disappointed I was expecting a better smell. It became my cologne for a regular day. I'll not buy it again.,2
477,This cologne by Adam Lavine smells exactly like grapefruits. It's a really strong citrus smell that belongs more on a housecleaner than your skin. My husband couldn't give it away so he left it in the men's room at a public place. Terrible!,1
477,Adam Levine mens Cologne has a Great Citrus Fresh smell. Great for your everyday use or a nice night on the town. But there is only one problem it has no staying power ,3
478,"I have been wearing Coty Wild Musk Cologne since I was in high school. It is most definitely my signature fragrance. I hate being without it so I stay stocked up! Loaded up on it with the last sale. I love the subtle fragrance and it stays with me all day. I even spray it into my brush and run it through my hair. An old friend gave me a hug recently and said, “Ah, that’s the scent I remember. It is definitely you.”",5
478,I am 58 and been using this perfume since I was 13!my family loves my smell and misses when I don’t have it on!!,5

478,"I have worn this perfume since high school and am now middle age. I love it because it's not strong, so after I spray it on I don't smell it anymore, but everyone who knows me recognizes it as my smell. Love it more than any other perfume I have ever purchased or worn!!",5
479,"John Varvatos Vintage is a fruity, cinnamon , manly fragrance that's not too over powering to wear everywhere and anytime. It's easy on the allergy and offends no one in the room as it is heavy enough to get you noticed but light enough that nobody backs away. It's my favorite scent to date because of it's cozy, spicy notes and subtle nature",5
479,"John Varvatos Vintage can be summed up in one word SEXY! I got this for hubby for Christmas a few years back, and well........ It makes my knees weak when he's wearing it! After 23 years of marriage I'd say that's a ringing endorsement! ",5
479,John Varvatos Vintage: Excellent. Classic. Long lasting. Bold but pleasant. ,5
479,"This is a great cologne, it smells incredible, It's one of my favorites. It has a very unique scent, it would be great for a fall, winter and night time. ",5
479,This is probaly my personal favorite fragrance in my arsenal. It has an extremely unique & appealing smell to my nose. I'm a huge fan of the bottle design as well. I don't wear it often because truthfully I only break it out on certain occasions. I do think this is a great addition to any collection.,4
480,"Throwback and vintage, good smelling cologne(still)...",4
480,I bought this for husband... He loves it really nice... Safari by Ralph Lauren... ,5
480,Safari an excellent cologne and have been using since 1995. I get allots compliments. Great product and last longer. Thanks Ralph Lauren...,5

481,I have been wearing Shalimar since the 60's. Will not use anything different. My one son used to keep one of my pillow cases under his pillow when I got very sick and was in the hospital. It gave him comfort to be able to smell his mom. Just thought that was a really lovely thing for him to do. I have always been given compliments on my sense. I am now 68 and will never switch fragrances.,5
481,My boyfriend bought me Shalimar when I was 16 Yr. old. He wanted me to wear it. I fell in love. I have worn it ever since. I will be 70 in July. Everyone knows me by Shalimar. My daughter wears Shalimar. The tradition continues. ,5
481,"I've worn Shalimar for 50 years. My Mom wore it too, and I think of her every time I spritz it on! A truly lovely fragrance. ",5
481,"My mother & her mother both wore Shalimar. I've been wearing it most of my life, as well. A very personal scent, and wearable anywhere, anytime. ",5
481,"Been living in a shower of Shalimar since the age of 19. Generously gifted to me, I fell in love; the relationship has lasted for over 40 years. While I wear it for myself, a sheer indulgence, the comments I often get from both women and men never fails to surprise; they either speak the name as they smile, or ask me what it is, I have never had a negative comment.",5
482,Received Coach as a mother's day gift for my partner that hasn't been opened due to being called out of town,5
482,Love the smell so much! A tip to make it last is spraying it on after you shower so it gets locked in and putting some on you hair brush and brushing your hair. I’ve gotten so many compliments.,5
482,"Coach EDT When i smelled this for the first time, i knew i had to have it. This is way better than the EDP imo, seeing as how its way too sweet for my liking. This fragrance is floral but clean. Lasts 4-6 hours on the skin. ",5
482,I love this scent.,5
482,Absolutely luvvv coach edt only wish it would last longer if it did I'd give a 5 star instead of 4!!!,4

484,"I only recently started wearing perfumes again, as my ex couldn' t tolerated fragrances. So after 20 plus years of not wearing any, I have ordered over 30 in the last 4 months. Love alot of the ones I have gotten, however this is one of my top 3. Beautiful bottle and equally beautiful scent. I am awaiting the other 2 by maxazria. Hoping I love them as much as this one.",5
484,This fragrance is the absolute best. I was so upset when they stopped selling it in department stores but then i found it here. the price is perfect. I purchased 3 just in case. ,5
484,"I don't like perfumes with musk, however I was tickled pink to know that this light, fruity, all day, long lasting fragrance features a light musk. This fragrance works so well w/ my body chemistry. I've worn some beautiful fragrances but this one seems to favor me like it was designed specifically for me in mind. People stop me all of the time to ask me what it is that I'm wearing. I really need a larger bottle because I run out too fast! Thanks MaxAzria! This one is tops!",5
484,"I was thrilled to find this perfume. I've looked everywhere. It's a fragrance that is not overpowering, but does last all day. I am asked all the time what I'm wearing. My husband loves it too.",5
484,"This is such a beautiful fragrance that lasts all day. My sister used it a few years ago and I remember asking her what it was as it smelled so feminine and soft on her. It has notes of violet, sandalwood and musk, and it a great fragrance to wear anytime. I love it!",5
485,Burberry Body is a Very nice and soft fragrance.,5
485,Love it! I receive compliments each time I wear it! Light smell ,5
485,"Burberry Body Tender smells fresh and clean ""I just stepped out of the shower"" fresh and clean. I really recommend this to everyone. It is very strong but not headache inducing and it lasted me 7hours before becoming a skin scent. My husband loves this on me.",5
485,My absolute favorite fragrance ever! I get so many compliments! One of the few perfumes that smell good on me! Love this! ,5
485,It's the perfect soft refreshing scent. I love it.,5
486,Great fragrance.. will buy from this company again.,5
486,Ch Prive Carolina Herrera is a rich and sweet fragrance that feels perfect for a nice date but isn't so cloyingly sweet that it feels out of place at work or during day wear. The whisky and leather are really pronounced in the best way possible. It's a great value for the price.,5
486,Nice love it for nights.....,5
486,Ch Prive Carolina Herrera a good one to have. ,5
486,"CH Prive great fragrance ,great longevity nice smell ",4
487,The red pole extreme is on fire Woody smell wonderful I put on the other day my girl say wat u got on I didn't buy that lol but she likes it,5
487,"Polo red extreme is the best amongst the Polo line, strong projection without being cloying. Great coffee and citrus opening then settles into a pleasant Woody gourmand scent. All day long you will smelling great. ",5
487,This fragrance is amazing and it goes all day. One of the best I've had. ,5

487,Great product great smell will recommend it my wife loves it,5
488,Absolutely love this perfume. Was given as a gift in the early 90's but was too expensive for me then...found it again here at a very reasonable price so I ordered several :),5
488,True Love by Elizabeth Arden is one of my favorite fragrances. It is light and floral. I don't care for heavy perfumes. One only needs a spray on the pulse points and it lasts all day. The scent smells lovely and I will order this again.,5
488,True love is a cologne I’ve been using for about 10 years and I’ve never wanted to use anything else,5
488,"I have had people stop me on the street and ask for the name of my cologne. It is light, airy, with a flowery scent and it makes you feel on top of the world! ",5
488,"True Love by Elizabeth Arden was another fragrance I ordered as a favor to my mom. She told me that I could open it and try it and I did. It is pleasant and soft but a bit too mature for me. It arrived quite fast. While I wouldn't buy it for myself, I still recommend it.",3
489,Femme is for me my all time 'go to perfume'. I have lots of fragrances that I love but for feeling fabulous and quite uplifted I would choose Hugo Boss Femme every time. I adore this fragrance it is sophisicated but light and fresh . I feel so indulged when I wear it. ,5
489,"Lovely. Delivered fast, thank you.",5
489,"HUGO BOSS FEMME IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCES HANDS DOWN. THIS IS A SULTRY SCENT THAT IS LONG LASTING AND JUST SMELLS SIMPLY WONDERFUL. I HAD A LADY IN THE GROCERY STORE COMPLIMENT MY PERFUME, SHE SAID SHE WAS 3 AISLES OVER AND COULD SMELL MY PERFUME SO SHE HAD TO ASK ME WHAT FRAGRANCE I WAS WEARING. ",5
489,"I may have found it - the scent I can call my own! Surprisingly when I let this one linger, it wasn’t loud and it didn’t smell typical of most fragrances - plain flowery. It’s delicate, attractive and soft. Loving it.",5
489,"Hugo boss femme is a lovely but delicate fragrance. I don't find anything casual about it at all. I'd say it's more on the romantic side,because of the sophisticated bottle design. A tad bit out of my budget but hey,a little splurge won't hurt now and then,would it? Just beautiful.",5
490,This was a gift for my sister in law who reports that she loves this perfume. The ordering and delivery were without issue and it came within the timeframe.,5

497,I first found out the name of this perfume from a Co worker who wore it the smell was lingering where ever she went and it smelled so beautiful I knew where ever she has been because the smell of her perfume so I asked her the name and has been my favorite since 4yrs strong ,5
497,Mariah Carey Forever smells really nice. It would be nicer if the cap had not broken as soon as I tried to open it. ,5
498,Power is Power ✊,5
498,I never like to run out of fifty cent power its one of my must haves,5
498,Power cologne is a great smelling fragrance and always one of my top choices no question ,5
498,50 cent power amazing and most underated cologne for men dazzling!!!,5
499,Perfect! I Love everything in this website ,5
499,"Excellent is a good perfume and has a good smell and lasts, it was received on the indicated date, thank you.",5
499,I do not like the smell of the 212. It’s just not for me at all ,1
499,212 sexy brings back memories. It smells unique and make you stand out.i am glad i got a good price for it cos it cost almost triple price at Macy's. I got the 3.4oz tester which is same as the normal bottle. I just love it!,5
499,212 Sexy is a beautiful fragrance. You feel sexy when you wear it. I have gotten so many complaints on it. ,5
500,Boss is my go to Fragrance!! I have used all the different types of Boss but this one I ordered (Boss Bottled Night) Was not one of them!! The Price was excellent! Shipping was fast! Give it a try and it might be the sent that works for you!!,3
500,Bottled Night is one of my favorite colognes. I has a very elegant and pleasant fragrance I think I will keep using it for a very long time. I like it a lot.,5
500,"Bottled Night by Hugo Boss smells really good, unfortunately it doesn't last too long. If it would last longer it would be a 5/5. My favorite remains Hugo by Hugo Boss.",4
500,"I like this scent! It's distinguished. This is a fall/winter fragrance for me but it's also my go-to anytime I want a more sophisticated scent. It's definateley on the heavier side. But it's not fluffy or powderish. No scent puff poofs getting stuck in the nose. I can't handle those kind! For Bottled Night, think India ink spilled on an old leather saddle that's been sitting in a cedar chest next to an old rubber tire.",4
500,Not my favorite. I would classify this as Salycic Acid meets sandlewood. Either your a teenager who wants to appear to be an old soul or an old mad who has an acne problem. Price and shipment was the high points.,1
501,"I already bought the sample, and now Iv have just finished purchasing a 3.4 oz. I am sure I will be pleased with it as well.",5
501,"Purchased Hanae Mori through you, wasn't sure if it was a copy cat fragrance and it was the real perfume!!! I was ecstatic as this saved me a huge amount over what I have paid at other stores. I absolutely love this perfume and can't wait to purchase a few more of my other favorite scents at such low prices!!",5
501,Hanae smells like La Vie Est Belle way too sweet and heavy for me. Would not buy full sized.,3
501,"Hanae by Hanae Mori, Totally in love with this perfume. You can't beat the prices from this website, so glad I found it. ",5
501,I would definitely repurchase this fragrance it smell very light and floral a definite dupe for flower bomb ,5
502,It just became my favorite cologne. It smells so good. ,5
502,"This cologne is one of the best on the market. Its very masculine and stays with you until you wash it off. Its not overpowering and doesn't choke the other people on the elevator. I usually put it on right before I get dressed for work, and Im ALWAYS getting compliments on it. So many of the colognes for men these days could really be unisex. Not this one. Its definitely a scent for a man. The price here was very good also. Try it, you're going to love it.!!",5
502,It smells very good,5
502,I might have not ordered the right one. Did not like the this one will order again hopefully I will order the right one the scent was not to my liking. ,3
502,This is my first time trying mr. Burberry I like almost all of the Burberry line of colognes for men this one did not disappoint unique smell and a great price fast delivery,5
503,"Tom Fords, Tobacco Vanille is a great parfum for men. It definitely lasts all day I received numerous compliments. It is a fantastic fragrance. I will be purchasing it again. ",5
503,Officially my new favorite scent beating out my Creed Green Irish Tweed. I find myself smelling my wrists randomly because it's THAT GOOD of a scent. ,5
503,Used to love this one but is so heavy on the cacao that makes me sick is too cloying rich like hot chocolate with too much splenda in it i prefer mancera red tabaco smell very similar but not as sugary how ever the perfume is great quality project like a monster stay on all day totally worth the price if you like this scent cant deny tom ford make amazing scents gave it 5 stars cuz The quality is undeniable ,5
504,"Jean Paul Gaultier Scandal smells like walking into any perfume store, so it's not terribly unique, as it claims. It is cloying and sickly when you first spray it. You can smell the citrus and honey, and then some powdery and spicy. I mean, it's fine if you like to smell like sugar. It begins to smell better with time. ",3
504,Scandal from Jean Paul is very sweet and mild I recommend it ,5
504,"Scandal is a must have, beautiful perfume a sexy gourmand.",5
504,Sweet honey-filled floral fragrance! My new favorite!,5
505,Sweet fragrance. Nothing beats this.,5
505," A classic masculine scent. ""Santos De Cartier,"" that I enjoy immensely. Men, or, women will enjoy this fragrance, so keep this in your collection.",5
505,"One of my favorites,have been wearing it since the early 80’s",5
505,Starting using Santos De Cartier in 1983 and still is the only cologne I use to date. ,5
505,Been using Santos ‘D Cartier for twenty years plus. Best evening fragrance I have experienced ,5
506,The coconut and lime are really present in this scent. Great fragrance 100% legit ,5
506,"It’s my first creed cologne “virgin island water” super happy,got a lot of compliments,,love the piña colada,sweet smell,it last all day,,definitely will recommend it !!!",5
506,Purchased Creed Virgin Island Water for my husband and it smells nice and clean for a man but I don’t think it’s a unisex cologne. ,5
506,"We live in South Florida so when my wife purchased Creed's Virgin island Water it became my signature Summer scent and in Florida, we have Summer year round. I was already an Aventus fan and Creed Royal Oud owner. Since we live in the tropics VIW is highly recommended whereas ANY Oud is better suited for the Las Vegas climes of dry heat where any Oud's muskiness stands-out. I've noticed each designer has their own Oud and Aventus copy, but there is only ONE Virgin Island Water! Well played, Creed, well played...",5
506,"I purchased the 4oz bottle of Virgin Island Water and received the same beautifully packaged, authentic Creed product that one would find at Neiman Marcus. My particular bottle has a silver cap and the new atomizer which has no visible neck and no Creed logo etching which does not mean its fake but rather means it is a brand new batch with a new bottle design. 100% satisfied and plan on buying from Fragrancenet in the near future.",5
507,"Gentleman by Givenchy eau de parfum is an amazing fragrance that got me a lot of compliments from the ladies, I highly recommended.",5
507,"Gentleman EDP is quite possibly my favorite fragrance in my small collection. It brings into perfect balance iris, vanilla and animalic nuances in a very dense and oriental way. It's a masterpiece of a perfume and it deserves a spot in your collection if you appreciate fragrances for the art (especially if you don't already own similarly heavy iris scents such as Valentino Uomo Intense). Longevity is excellent at 12+ hours; will last for days on your clothes. Projection is moderate; doesen't get cloying. Great for formally dressed nights.",5
507,This cologne is very beautiful.,5
508,Great summertime fragrance. I always get compliments on it. Love it. What a great deal. ,5
508,Pleasures intense Love love love the sent. Last all day,5
508,I Purchased Pleasures Intense Love Love the scent very Beautiful scent definitely a Conversation starter. Will order again.,5
508,"Pleasures Intense by Estee Lauder, magnificent smell. My wife loves it.",5
508,My special love lover and I are addictive to this fragrance. It’s a fact that it’s reaction with my skin is the best!,5
509,"Tom Ford Noir Extreme, It’s just what it says.. EXTREME.. This stuff smells so amazing. I order a small bottle online because I was not sure if I would like it. I will definitely be ordering the bigger bottle. I must say I will be checking the other collections out as well.",5
509,Best cologne I’ve ever smelt but the reviews are correct does not last long at all ,4
509,"Im a woman and i saw another woman on youtube said she wears it so i was very intrigued and head over the store omg this is sweeter then the woman version noir pour femme , this one is delicious sexy is a soft scent doesnt project far i told my tom ford sells guy that this smells just like his favorite oud fleur perfume but much softer he was shocked to smell both he never noticed it since i like deeper stronger more seductive scent i prefer the noir pour femme still the one is amazing even many man say the woman version is way better haha ",5
509,Tom Ford Noir Extreme is a great fragrance! I get so many compliments on how good it smells on me! Gets you in trouble Fellas!! Sam - Detroit,5
509,"A big fan of Tom Ford especially tobacco vanille which can come off a little strong. This is a smoother, quieter version, that I feel in my opinion is actually easier to wear. It's it's in the background but it's always there.",5
510,"One of my all time favorites. Love the Noir, however Essence is a wonderful scent. Immediately draws my attention to the uplifting masculine yet smooth scent. Reccomended it to men of all ages.",5
510,I bought Drakkar Esssence for my 17 year old. He gets compliments every time he wears it . ,5
510,"Drakkar Essence Nice smell and my lady loves it, really fellas that’s all that matters. ",5
510,"Drakkar Essence is a fresh, invigorating scent perfect for the workplace and any casual circumstance. I smelled this for the first time in the summer of 2015 and thought it was a new release because it smelled so modern...I was floored when I discovered it was released in 1972! If it hasn't been updated over the decades to avoid smelling outdated, then Guy Laroche was way ahead of his time with this scent. Could stand to last longer for sure, but with it's affordable price, you can reapply when needed and it won't break the bank.",3
510,"Recently, I purchased Drakkar's Essence and am impressed in the following ways: 1. It is a completely satisfying and delightful fragrance. 2. It has an attention-getting impact, yet it is not cloying t the point that you wish the person wasn't nearby. 3. I will continue to order and use Drakkar Noir as a satisfying alternative to Essence. But they are two entirely different fragrances. 4. I am frankly and pleasantly surprised at the speed of the delivery and the packaging. 5. The price is certainly reasonable. Therefore: I'll be back on both of these fine essences. Nice job, Guy Larouche! John H. Langford",3
511,"I didn’t like it, it’s so suite, I prefer flower’s fragances",2
511,"I didn’t like it, it’s so suite, I prefer flower’s fragances",2

Thank you to this site for offering it. and at at a good price. I go every year on Black Friday to purchase a new scent at Macy's and try to get one comprable to this but nothing beats Lou Lou. Gertiemae",5
511,"Lou Lou is a timeless fragrance,no matter what age you are,where you wear it,or even if you associate it with good or sad memories. I can't think of anyone hating on this beauty unless they're doing it secretly. It's been around forever so I'll be buying mine pretty soon,for old time's sake.",5
511,Lou Lou eau de parfum by Chacherel is the fafourite perfume of both my daughters and they are thrilled that I found it for them as it seemed to be unavailable here in Australia or elsewhere. On their behalf I thank you and know they would give it top rating.,5
512,Bucheron. One of my favorite cologne. Ic DThe scents are subtle and soft. Great for any event and weather. ,5
512,"I ordered Boucheron cologne for men, LOVE IT!!! Please send additional samples of any new men's cologne for me to try. Thanks",5
512,"I ordered Boucheron cologne for men for the first time and I am very happy with everything about this item. It is a great scent that is ""settles in"" and is not overpowering. I highly recommend this cologne.",5
512, I can't remember all the scents I have used over the years. This is the first time I have had favorable comments on the scent from both men and women...it's the best!,5
512,"This cologne has been my staple cologne for years now and I still get compliments, sometimes in an off way like ""Are you going out tonight?"", ""What's with this cologne you wear every day? You're already married!"" and so on. Boucheron ""for Men"" is a timeless scent. This is still a very sophisticated cologne.",5
513,"I bought Dolce & Gabbana Pour Femme off the website after being disappointed with the smell of a bottle I bought from a beauty store at a price much higher. I am very happy with my purchase, it came quickly and smells amazing! I will be ordering again as I just saw they have the gift box with the shower gel and lotion! ",5
513,This is my wife's second favorite perfume the first being Paloma Picasso and many of her friends always comment on the fragrance and go out and buy both !! ,5
513,"Dolce & Gabbana Pour Femme is intoxicating! Subtle but powerful, my signature scent for several years. The first time I smelled it I was hooked. I have many, many other perfumes (much more expensive) that just sit there unused. ",5
513,"D&G Pour Femme is such a pleasant smelling fragrance. Not heavy and strong nor is it sickeningly sweet and it's perfect for all seasons, especially the hot summers. I get many compliments when wearing it.",5
513,"Excellent, In love ,mega like,,,, thanks !!",5
514,"Geurlain L'homme Ideal Cologne edt is a very fresh, invigorating, manly sweet fragrance that is very in offensive but very intriguing scent. I was pleasantly surprised at first sniff. I found myself constantly sniffing my clothes and moving around to catch whiffs of the scent in the air. The first day I wore it I got a few unsolicited compliments. I'm very happy with my purchase and I plan on picking up more from this line. It's a winner for sure. Very fresh and unique!",5
515,excellent product obsession spray,5
515,"Excellent product!, my husband love it!",5
515,"Perfect product for me. It was recommended by my dermatologist because I have very sensitive skin and Obsession is the only one I am not allergic to, because it does not contain colorings! The fragrance is very aromatic. ",5
515,it is the only deodorant i have used for many years it is mild to skin .,5
515,"I’ve always loved Obsession is been my go to scent for at least Twenty years and a good deal on top of that you just can’t go wrong!!! And they had the deodorant which otherwise is very hard to find, not here it’s everyday all day. Thanks FragranceNet you definitely have a new customer in me.....",5

517,Jaguar pure instinct. Nice soft smell.,4
517,"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this fragrance. The price is so fantastic, I can't believe it. Jaguar Classic is such a wonderful scent that it will be in my collection forever. It just smells so good and different from any other colognes I have tried in the last 50 years of being a cologne freak. I can't believe that I spent over $20.00 somewhere else instead of purchasing it here for $13.00. This price is a steal for this cologne. You would be surprised how many people ask what your wearing. It is a classy little fragrance that I don't want other's to know about. Let's just say that it's "" My Little Secret"" and leave it at that. ",5
518,"I'm a classic guy who always uses classic cologne like Azzaro and Arams, The first time I was introduced to CH when I was on a trip to a friend of mine and what really attracted me is how unique and settle the scent, as a classic man, I like to my cologne to be calm and not spreading all around the place, I have to say, the scent of CH is so extravagant and distinguished to the level where it makes me uncomfortable sometimes...I highly recommend it!",5
518,"Excellent cologne.. I have finished 2 bottles so far and will order again. Perfect for 3 season except summer.. stay long on skin and smells better after instant spray, first you notice leather with strong notes than leave nice balance of fresh flower smell on your body! Recommended!",5

521,"Lancome Hypnose is like summer in a bottle, I love it so much!! I know it smells different on everyone but for me its the most amazing spring and summer fragrance Ive ever tried. Every time I wear it, it reminds me of the beach, carnivals, ice cream trucks and everything great about summer!!",5
521," I fell under the spell of Hypnose several years ago, and it is now the favorite of my three regular fragrances, another one being Lancôme's Magie Noir. Now I hear that Hypnose, too, is being discontinued. I've been searching everywhere for Hypnose body lotion and it only seems to exist now in a holiday promotional package offered at Macy's. So absolutely frustrating to find fragrances that I love and want to be my forever, signature fragrance and then have them discontinued....or only available in perfume, but not the lotions and body powders! ",5
521,"Hypnosis ,by Lancôme ,my favorite ,and a very affordable buy Thanks",5
521,"Oh, I love Hypnose I just found this website, and that you can buy perfume at a discounted price. I wore Hypnose in New York City, and really loved the frangance. Its so excotic; so I really can't wait to buy some more. I'm now living in Michigan. Ladies this is the best perfume around. ",5

526,"Very pretty fragrance! I just recently got into Lacoste perfumes. This one reminds me a little bit of the pour femme but spicier and more citrus. This one is a little bit of everything: sweet, spicy, citrusy and girly. Sits close to the skin and is light and fresh. Definitely a “clean” sort of scent which will be great to wear to the office without offending any patients or coworkers! I also love the pretty bottle. Thumbs up.",5
526,I love my touch of pink! 100% recommended ,5

530,Creed aventus was definitely a good buy. Long lasting fragrance just like the men fragrance. Well Worth it....,5
530,"Creed Aventus for her most certainly gets 98% of men's attention in any room you enter and other women want to know the name of it so they can purchase. I had it on during my first date with my fiance' and he later told me that he couldn't stop thinking about me because my scent remained in his sweater from our first hug. Ladies, if you want to make a lasting impression on a man, add this to your collection and I guarantee it will NOT disappoint. P.S. our wedding is this October after only a year and a half engagement!!!",5

532,"I have used Pierre Cardin Cologne for quite a while and women seems to be attracted to the scent of it. I get quite a few hugs and I had one lady tell me that she could just grab and kiss. I might have gone along with that but she was an older lady, you have to be respectful. I really like the size that I was able to purchase and it's a spray, I don't have to pour it in my hands. ",5
532,"Pierre Cardin....the best....been wearing since age 13.....now 59 and never met anyone that did not really like it. Very unique and has that perfect ,subtle scent that is right for any occasion. Amazing that all age groups would always compliment the scent.",5

533,Love this fragrance smell super.....,5
533,"Bvlgari Man Extreme smells great on the opening. Citrus, woodsy, cactus is wonderful. This lasts for about 30 mins and then is barely even a skin scent after that. I have tested this on others and on paper with the same result. If you want a shower scent to refresh after some sweaty work, then maybe this is it.",2
533,"Me encanta esta fragancia , un olor agradable, la recomiendo para todo aquel que desee sentirse bien.",5
533,"I've been a big fan of the original BVLGARI (the folks who sell high quality diamonds and gems) for yrs. I thought that I'd the BVUGARI MAN EXTREME especially for the winter months. It does indeed meet all expectations, but IT IS Extreme. A little goes a long way & lasts for hrs. I also recommend the shower gel.",4
534,"Seventeen years ago my boyfriend gave me a gift set with powder, lotion, perfume and bath gel of G by Georgio for my 60th birthday. It immediately became one of my favorites. It works well with my body chemistry. I still wear it regularly...especially in the warm weather. My boyfriend died three years ago, but my love for the perfume he gave me still lives on. Fragrancenet, thankfully, keeps it available for me and I am very thankful that it is still for sale thru them at a wonderful discount. Such a beautiful fragrance and lovely designed purple bottle sitting on my dressing table. I spritz it on daily. Purple is my favorite color, too. Light floral/fruity and every time I wear it I get compliments. As long as I can purchase it, I will wear it. Gerry N.",5

535,"My Mother In Law Loves this perfume, we buy it for her when we travel to see her. She loves it and has been using it for years and years.",4
535,Paris by Yves Saint Laurent in this current iteration is fine compared to the vintage. I have both and have been wearing it since the ‘80s. Today’s version may not be identical to the past version but it is close enough to enjoy it the same. Highly recommended feminine floral classic fragrance that will have you receiving remarks from others.,5
535,Have worn this fragrance for 20 years the best fragrance I have ever smelt,5

538,This is the best cologne I ever smelled I absolutely love it!,5
538,Zion Davidoff very nice I love it,5
538,This fragrance is old as hell but women seem to love it. I remember wearing this 30 years ago. Sometimes I love it and sometimes it smells nasty - almost like dust and I'm not sure why. It's definitely unique and you won't mistake it for anything else. Giving it 5 stars - a real classic.,5
539,I bought it for my husband he loves it and I like the way it smells on him so so good 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ In my book,5

540,"I have loved Thierry Mulger Cologne for years but it is getting more difficult to find. It is so clean, fresh smelling. I purchased two but maybe I should get more while it is still around. Your service was excellent, as well.",5
540,"I purchased the Mugler cologne 100ml offering of this outstanding product and upon spraying and smelling immediately I thought, ""I should have bought the bigger bottle."" Next time I will! The genius of simplicity...it's my cup of tea!",5
540,I’ve purchased the 3.4oz and my only regret is that I only got the 3.4oz. I’ve already used 1/6th of the juice in one week. I use it before and afterwork and just when I want to bask myself in some smell good. It just smells good. I will be purchasing the 10oz next month. This will probably be my signature scent.,5
540,MUGLER COLOGNE: Great fresh scent that lasts all day!!,5
540," MUGLER COLOGNE WOW!..This one was on my radar for a while but I wasn't quite convinced that a cologne that smelled like soap is attractive. I was always in pursuit of a fresh and clean fragrance that doesn't come across as cologne. While many having reviewed this in the fragrance community, it seems the consensus is that it resembles a soap smell - Irish Spring in particular. I took the plunge, and had a fair idea of what I'd be getting/ smelling. Upon first whiff I was beyond delighted. I actually recall saying WOW! out loud with a smile. This was much more than what I expected! It has a zesty citrus zing at the top which is an absolute delight! Sure, I suppose you could say it's soapy, but I don't get the reference to Irish Spring. If this smells like soap, then it's the best smelling soap I've ever smelled. I don't think that the reference to say it just smells soapy, really does this justice. It's so much more. It is straight forward and linear but just a gorgeous fragrance! I'd say, right now, this is my new favourite cologne. Of course time will tell, but this is really the sort of fragrance I've been longing for. There's just no way anyone could find this unattractive, offensive or unsuitable. Unless it's inappropriate to smell clean. This can be worn anyplace, anytime. This scent induces positive energy and calmness. To me this smells like zestful rays of sunshine!",5
541,He recibido mi tester y adoro este perfume ! Ya lo necesitaba en mi pequeña colección!!,5
541,I dearly love this fragrance. Can't hardly wait to get a new bottle. Don't want to to be without it. I get so many compliments on this fragrance.,5
541,"Never fails to get a compliment when I am wearing Treso Midnight Rose. I was in getting my oil changed and the gentleman working behind the desk said to me "" can I tell you something "". I said * sure "" he proceeds to tell me what ever that is you are wearing you smell SCRUMPTIOUS !! LMBO ",5
541,"Nov. 13,2018, ""Tresor"" Midnight roses! I love it when I walk into a room and some one asks, ""What are you wearing?!"" You smell so good! Happens every time! Oh, my husband loves it too! Cindy Ste. Marie",5
541,"Tresor Midnight Rose eau de parfum by Lancome is a truly lovely, feminine, unique and classy scent for women who are looking for something special that is off the beaten path. It's first note scent is exactly raspberry and rose which combine beautifully. As it begins to blend with your own chemistry, you begin to appreciate the warmer notes of vanilla, musk and just a touch of cedar. It is a very romantic scent so would do well at evening dinner, the bedroom(hint hint), and night time in general. This does not seem to be a scent for teenage girls because its notes speak to me of full-blown passionate womanliness. If any man reading this wants to give a memorial gift to his lady, present her with this, and a bouquet of deep red roses. The perfume will remind her of that day LONG after the flowers wither!",5
542,Super strong fragrance! The melon note is super nice! I love this cologne,5
542,"Was gifted this fragrance from a relative. I always associated Abercrombie and Fitch fragrances as being cheap, overbearing and generic...but this fragrance surprised me!

I would highly recommend this for younger guys. A great fragrance!!",4
542,"I love this perfum it smells fresh and summery! It’s great for casual everyday wearing. In addition, it was a fast delivery and great service.",5

543,"I've gotten so many compliments when wearing Ange ou Demon le secret. The most touching compliment was when one of my patients in the hospital who was recoverying from a stroke lifted up his head & made a sniffing sound & said, ""you smell good."" This compliment really made my evening. This fragrant got the attention of someone who was sick & slightly sluggish. He perked up with a smile of approval because it was a soft, pleasant, scent .

544,The name speaks for itself. Have used it for years. It never gets old.,5

So I hit up the big dogs: Creed Vetiver, Creed Aventus, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather and even Chanel NO.5 pure parfum. Although I love those scents too and they last all day and then some, it was something about the Amber Pour Homme that smelled so fresh and intoxicating. I had to go and repurchase. When I wear this I feel as if I just stepped out of the shower of a high-end hotel using top-notch soap. Never could be happier with my decision to rebuy this fragrance. NOTE: To make my toilette colognes last longer, I apply vaseline on my chest then spray the cologne so it will stick to the compounds and not fade away as quickly. Guaranteed to last most, if not, all day.",5

564,One of my BEST! Perfume ever! ,5
564,"Great perfume, my wife loved it.",5
564,"My Burberry smells clean, modern, and classy! The scent lasts all day!! I love the original Burberry, so I decided to buy a mini bottle of My Burberry to try. So glad that I did because I like it so much that I've added it to my long list of 'favorites' !!",5
564,"I ordered this perfume without knowing how it smelled, I just took a chance from reading the reviews. I received it, sprayed it on and was like EH, its ok. Then like 5 min later the smell was getting to me and I just kept sniffing. I swear I have SO many perfumes and this is the only one I have been wearing since I got it. It smells amazing and I cannot get enough it. Its my favorite perfume and Wow does it last ALL day. I love perfumes that last, and only Burberry seems to last forever. I have Burberry Body (that one is good too) and that lasts days as well. So glad I bought this perfume! You will not be disappointed.",5
564, I love it that’s my favorite one out of all the perfumes I have tried ,5
565,"Paul Sebastian After Shave Balm, is great on the skin. Living in Arizona where it is so dry, this keeps the skin moist. Used it for many years. People are surprised at my age, due to very few wrinkles! ",5
565,I have been using PS for years. The fragrance exudes a real sense of manliness. People often ask me the name of the fragrance I am wearing. Thanks for this site to order.. One retailer informed me that the after shave balm is no longer available. I notice that you are showing clearance on the advertisement page. Please advise. ,5
565,I HAVE PURCHASED PS BALM OVER THE YEARS WITH SATISFACTION. THIS PAST ORDER OF 3 BTLS IS A DISAPPOINTMENT SINCE THE BALM HAS LITTLE IF ANY ODOR.,1
565,"have been wearing paul sebastian cologne four years, have had numerous people of all ages men and women ask what i was wearing , love this product , balm also great.",5
565,"I have been using Paul Sebastian products exclusively for years. I like layering so I use the deodorant, cologne after shave and after shave balm. Frequently I have had staff in restaurants, clerks in stores, people waiting in lines with me and even strangers on the street come up to me and ask what fragrance I am wearing. They comment on how clean and refreshing the fragrance is. I am definitely the kind of person who would attract attention otherwise so it is definitely my fragrance. My only disappointment is that I can no longer get the moisturizer. That was a great product and I miss it. ",5
566,The smell I was after. This is gonna be my everyday cologne.,5
566,"Royal Copenhagen musk is fantastic fragrance , long lasting perfum!!.",5
566,Incredible scent that all people favourably comment on and ask where to get it .. I've used this product for over 40 years and no other even comes close ..Its fresh yet sophisticated and alluring ..,5
566,first time i get musk royal copenhagen and i love it very much ,4
566,Royal Copenhagen Musk has a nice clean smell. not over powering but they do know you are wearing it.,3
567,This fragrance is divine smells so fresh clean just love it !! ,5
567,Wow! Awesome and captivating! Perfect for summer!,4
567,"Hermes Un Jardin sur le Nil Is my new favorite scent. I also bought it for my daughter who loved it on me and now wears it daily. The bottle and packaging just makes me happy, also! The fragrance is just what I always want in a perfume because it is not sweet or harsh..but so fresh and natural...it should be sprayed in a theater playing ""Mid Summer Night's Dream"" or something just as beautiful...just a lovely scent!",5
567,Been using this perfume for many years and always get compliments. Family friends asked me the name & brand of the perfume & that's what they give their wife as a gift. ,5
567,"A charming scent, subtil and fresh at same time. I love it.",5
569,If you are looking for an affordable men's cologne then Guess Seductive Homme is just what the doctor ordered. The cologne has an alluring scent that isn't overpowering. It isn't probably going to get you the compliments of the more expensive colognes either but I like this one for work or a quick during the week date and save the more expensive fragrances for the weekends. Can't really go wrong with the price as there is good value here. ,4
569,Seductive as it says & smells. Great purchase.,4
569,Smells great Not long lasting thou,4
569,GUESS SEDUCTIVE....Has an amazing scent....that's very alluring....yes..sexy. A masculine scent that has an aura of class and elegance. It has great staying power and you often get 'hits' of the scent every once in a while while you're wearing it..reminding you how great the scent is...definitely should be in your fragrance arsenal....''SEDUCTIVE'' is what this scent really is.,5
569,"Guess Seductive Homme is a great all around cologne for every occasion. It's a little bit musky but in a subtle way and leaves just a bit of citrus freshness in the end. Reminds me of a crisp, cool, freshly ironed white shirt waiting for it's tie. Great clean scent for corporate or the club, this is a must in your collection. It is an attractive cologne and will garner much female attention.",5
570,All of the Invictus are GREAT!!! I have intense and now aqua! These are compliments catching scents all day!! Love IT,5
570,"This is the hottest fragrance on the market right now. If you don’t believe me, just ask the ladies. I get so many compliments when I am wearing this. It is definitely attractive and draws attention from the women. Cannot go wrong with this one.",5
570,"Invictus Aqua is great for summer. Kind of a lighter, sportier version of Invictus. It maintains that great smell.",5
570,Absolutely loved it great gift the paco rabanne Invictus aqua,5
570,"I was not a fan of Paco Rabanne before specially like strong 1 million cologne but when I have tried the Invictus Aqua omg! this is awesome cologne and fall in love with it. skip in the winter time but this cologne is great for warmer weather, even males asking me what cologne I wear :) ",5
571,I own all the scents in the Elizabeth and James Nirvana line and Bourbon is one of my favourites. I feel this scent is fairly unisex. I find the scent warm and a little sweet and makes me feel cozy when I wear it. Works very well as a fall/winter scent. I am sad that this line seems to be discontinued as I really enjoy it. Grab it while you can!,5
571,Nirvana Bourbon...I LOVE IT!!!!! ,5
571,This scent is amazing! I get more compliments on it than any other perfume I wear! ,5
571,I’m a Bourbon drinking Gal and this essence suites me to a tee! Fabulous to say the least!,5
571,Just started wearing it and love it! Elizabeth and James Nirvana Bourbon!,5
572,It was a birthday present for my granddaughter!!! She loves it!!!!! ,5
572,I love this fragrance it’s my all time favorite and I also love the Versace line I love them all. ,5
572,Doesn't last very long. Disappointed because the men's version lasts forever and smells awesome,2
572,My wife loves it . It's her signature now. ,4
572,Smell good but weak and it didn't last. ,2
573,I have been wearing it for years I have tried others but no comparison for me. I get lots of compliments on the wonderful fragrance smell ,5
573,"Hay girls this is the Bomb but you must be careful which Hanae Mori, that you pick and I have tried them all and have found that the Reddish Pink box is the more mature fragrance and as for the Blue box I find that it is more youthful, playful. I am more of the mature age but when I have this on most of my compliments come from OUR MEN young and old and we all know that is who we put it on for RIGHT !",5
573,"Hanae Mori eau de parfum is an intoxicating scent filled with creamy base notes of sandalwood, rosewood, cedar and almond tree, with middle notes of peony, jasmine and ylang-ylang and top notes of black currant, strawberry, blackberry and blueberry. This oriental fragrance is soft and elegant leaving all who pass you to say, ""Mmmm you smell dreamy.""",5
573,No to bad Hanae Mori,4
573,I love Hanae Mori eau de parfum and parfum it have nice scent.,5
574,"I bought this scent on a whim about 6 years ago and love it even more than when I first bought it. My mom really likes this scent on me, and she is a hard one to please!!! I even gave her a bottle. It is a true feminine fragrance. ",5
574,This perfume is wonderful a.light soft sent for those who don't like to have thier perfume arvive before them. Arrived in great shape & as expected Thanks!,5
574,Love Tracy by Ellen Tracy hope I can continue to buy and never discontinued service the best,5
574,"I get so many complaments when I wear this fragrance. ""Tracy""..... Bu Ellen Trace",5
574,"Love, love this fragrance!!!! I have been wearing it for years and I hope they still carry it forever! It is a wonderful smell that doesn't over power! Everyone tells me how much I smell good.",5
575,"This smells great on me. For some reason it gets compared to Aventus, but it's nothing like Aventus at all so I don't understand the comparison. I get lots of compliments when wearing Viking.",5
575,"Viking to me is fresh, bold, and spicy. Strength in a bottle. I prefer this over a lot of other Creed fragrances, surprisingly, and with fragrancenet's great prices I am hyped to have this in my wardrobe.",4
575,Smell wonderful love the travel size. My wife loves the smell as well ,5
575,"Most people want to measure this scent by the bar set by Aventus. I think this does a major disservice to Viking. They are different animals. Aventus is an amazing scent that has great appeal and a tough act to follow. Viking is not a follow-up to Aventus. Viking is a complex mix of fresh, smooth, smoky and a hint of spice. the longer you wear it the more it changes in profile. Give this richly diverse addition to the Creed line a go. You won't be disappointed. ",5
575,I love it Is the best one to buy,4
576,"Pasha de Cartier Edition Noire,it's a very Good option for men.",5
576,Pasha de cartier edición noire es una aroma fresca agradable especial para el hombre se las recomiendo ,5
576,"This one of my favorites! Has slight mild peppery, sweet, floral scent.",5
576,This is a Great sent for a man with style.,5
577,"I have been a Red Door user for years! I love the clean light scent and get so, so many compliments on it. I use the perfumed body lotion as well as the deodorant and I LOVE that there is this deodorant to match my perfume of choice. It goes on easy, works wonderfully well and I cannot imagine ever changing my everyday scent! Thank you Elizabeth Arden for the scent and Fragrance Net for the great deals!",5
577,Red door deodorant great product for me,4
577,"I have exclusively worn Red Door for several years. It goes on light, doesn't stain your clothes and has a clean scent that doesn't clash with any lotion or fragrance I choose to wear. My husband also likes and uses it, so I stock up when I purchase.",5
578,Un poco clásico se parece a euphoria de CK ,5
578,Un poco clásico se parece a euphoria de CK ,5
578,I enjoy Uomo so much that I am using this cologne as my daily driver during the day. The projection and crisp clean scent of Uomo is unlike any other. I like it so much that I'm buying 2 bottles (1 for wearing and 1 as a backup) . The presentation of the bottle is awesome. Very well thought out by the house of Zegna. You can't go wrong with Ermenegildo Zegna fragrances. ,5
578,Love the fragrance and the price ,5
578,Bought it this morning. Smelling really good. I might wear it for Christmas or I may stick to wearing my Burberry (Burgundy Box). ,5
579, Nice smell sweet ....,5
579,VIP MEN 212 LOVE THE SMELL ,5
579,212 VIP is a great sent. It is long-lasting and it doesnt take much product to notice the sent. You're good with just one spray!,5
579,212 vip Smells good reminds me of a piña colada perfect for summer,4
579,I purchased this for my husband about two years age. EVERYTIME he wear this cologne he get lots of compliments!!! If you're looking for a sophisticated fragrance...….THIS IS THE ONE!!,5
580,"My daughter called me and asked to come by her work and try out a new fragrance that she really liked. She knew I was looking something new and different, so I did. I'm not a guy that really likes a strong scent on me, but Chrome United didn't have that at all., plus I really liked it. As I used this product I received so many compliments from the ladies, many of them asked me what are you using, because they wanted their man to try it. Fortunately, I can still receive Chome United from here and pay a GREAT PRICE from here, too. I give this 5-star rating, guys, I recommend it. if you want to try something different or you're looking for a new scent for your lady, give it a try. What do you have to lose? ",5
580,"Azzaro Chrome United has a very nice smell. I tried a lot of scents for my husband, had to find one that appealed to him and to me, not always an easy thing to accomplish. I paid a much higher price in the department stores for this scent and would do so again if I didn't find it here. Great price, easy shipping, what more could you ask?",5
580,"I bought this for my son he really love it. It smells awesome. I personally love the price , Thank you very much. ",5
580,Chrome United is by far the best fragrance by Azzaro. It is the perfect balance between light and dark scents. A must buy for fans of the Chrome line.,5
580,"Azzaro chrome United Very nice one..love it,one of my favorites..I will recommend..",5
581,I enjoy this new cologne from David Beckham. It has a very unique smell and I have received many compliments. I have added this cologne to my favorite list. I will be purchasing more. ,5
581,"D.Beckham Instinct Excellent long lasting and it wont change at later time, once it sits on your skin it will stay on it even next day. Excellent product for the price.",5
581,"I tried David Beckham Instinct for the first time it's a very lite fragrance that's okay. It doesn't last long, I tired something new but won't buy it again!",2
581,I like this product for my self,5
581,Instinct is not over powering but has an aroma that is very different then many popular brands. It will last for hours and is sweet. Not for the guy who has problems with his masculinity and can be worn on the first date to get the upper hand. I recommend this for anyone looking to add to his collection.,4
582,A good casual scent. A 3.4 oz designer scent for under 15.00. You could go wrong but in this case you won't. It's a great value purchase. ,5
582,Love Kenneth Cole Reaction T-Shirt cologne. Great fresh scent. Not as good as the Original T-Shirt...but at these prices. Great buy,5
582,"Excellent fragrance, very subtle, it's a very nice summer fragrance to wear at pool parties and other out door activities. ",5
582,"It's a fresh clean smell, not overpowering. Nice for the warm weather.",4
582,i didn't like this fragrance at all did not smell good on me and i hate the scent smell does not agree with me at all ,1
583,I absolutely love Vince Camuto Amore but unfortunately it doesn't last long at all.,2
583,It’s a great perfume I love it ,5
583,I truly can’t go without Vince Camuto Amore!! It was a gift from my husband years ago and I fell in love with it! Great fragrance! ,5
583,I’ve already received compliments on this lovely fragrance. I enjoy all the Vince Camuto fragrances that I’ve tried. They also make lovely gifts. ,5
583,I absolutely Love it! ,5
584,"Just OK for me. This is a very fresh floral, suitable for warm weather. I like the initial spray but then there is something in this I don't really like...maybe the lily of the valley. I have Fancy and Fancy Love both of which I enjoy and would repurchase. I won't repurchase this one. I have a 30 ml bottle and like it enough to wear around the house. It lasts a few hours on my skin.",2
584,I Fancy you smells really good. I am pleased with this fragrance ,5
584,"I Fancy You by Jessica Simpson is a very light and lovely scent. However, the scent does not last very long. I've even tried spraying my scarf in hopes the scent would last more than an hour but it just faded away. The scarf is polyester so it's washable and when I took it off to wash it there was not any scent left after wearing only 4 hours. I would not buy this fragrance again as I require my parfum to last longer.",1
584,Love this. So does everyone around m get compliments all the time. Fancy You ,5
584,It was ok. I had purchased Fancy Girl and read the reviews for I Fancy U along with checking out the scent. The notes were similar so I bought it. There is something in it that smells like a flower. It’s got strong scent of honey and gardenia. It doesn’t smell bad but it doesn’t smell good on my skin with my natural smell.,3
585,"Adam Levine, probably one of the least expensive perfumes, I have ever purchased and one of the best. Its light scent makes me feel energetic when I wear it. Great staying power, I get alot of, what perfume are you wearing. While doesn't want to hear that.",5
585,Adam Levine's perfume is my absolutely favorite. I buy a least three at a time. ,5
585,"Adam Levine for women is a long lasting luscious fragrance. Not flowery, too sweet but clean smelling. I love it. I wish I had bought 2 bottles.",5
585,I love the smell........it's a very like smell and I'm loving it !!!!,5
585,I love this Adam Levine Spray this is my second bottle ..it can in a reasonable amount of time..& the price was very reasonable..I will order again...,5
586,Really loving the Creed Love in White perfume! It’s a fresh floral with an interesting twist! Very unique and I like that.....a woman with a alluring signature scent. Thanks to Fragrance net for making this attainable for us because Creed is quite pricey.,5
586,A friend was wearing one day and kind of reluctanted about telling me the name of the fragrance. Probably thought i couldn't afford. But it smelled heavenly on her and i kept asking. Love in white by creed is my favorite. I get stopped in Walmart and at the malls all the time. What r u wearing ???? It is pricey but worth every penny ,5
586,Beautiful summer fragrance when Michelle Obama was in her first year as 1st Lady she named this as her favorite scent and I ran and bought it so this is my homage to her. Very elegant fragrance. ,5
586,"So light and fresh.. More of a spring scent to me, but lovely nonetheless ",4
586,My favorite. Creed love in white is such a pleasant soft smell. Not over powering. Just right. Will always have this in my scent collection. ,5

587,Wonderful perfume and the price was great. Highly recommend,5
587,"Eternity Now will always be noticed. Very subtle, but stll lingers in the background. Beautiful fragrance.",5
588,Well I have good things to say about This product I bought it because it remind me of X and I got for my son's ,5
588,"I purchased Insurrection for my husband a few years ago. The first time he wore it I was hooked. The scent is strong but not over powering and it lasts all day. Even with the nature of his work he still comes home with the scent in his clothes. He gets compliments everywhere he goes about his Cologne. This is our #1 fragrance. Ordering was easy, shipping was on time the first few orders. Although my last order never came, I had to reorder again but it's worth it. ",5
588,I bought this for my husband and he gets so many compliments no matter where he goes. Insurrection smells amazing and lasts all day even after he comes home from work. ,5
588,"WONDERFUL SMELL, WOMEN LOVE IT AND THOSE WHO WONT ADMIT IT ALWAYS LOOK BACK AND SMILE",5
588,"insurection, the one dominate aroma that lasts and lasts . the women love it and those who dont comment always look back and smile.",5
589,"I ordered Prada Candy for myself for Christmas and loved it so much I went back and ordered the Candy Kiss also and it came in time for New Years and I love love love.

590,"A Very Beautiful and a very Expensive smelling scent. I don't see it as ""old lady"", it is for a sophisticated woman (25 and up). This perfume last a long time (+10 hrs on skin, days on clothing), its very unique and worth the price. ",5
590,"I read several reviews about this scent and was searching for something similar to VS dark orchid which has a very sexy and sensual smell. This particular fragrance to me smelled like something a senior 65 and up would wear! I was very disappointed with the amount I spent. My signature scent is Burberry Britt, which lasts all day. This scent is very musky, and smells to similar to other cheap scents you would find at places like Burlington, Marshall’s etc , defiantly cannot smell anything high end about this scent. Will not buy again and do no recommend ",1
590,"Tom Ford Velvet Orchid I really didnt like it, reminded me of old lady perfumes.",1

I really, really love this fragrance. I plan to make sure I keep it on the shelf in my house. The bottle it comes in is absolutely gorgeous too Yes, Yes Yes! Blossom is awesome.

598,"The bottle is super cute, but the fragrance was the lovely surprise! Blind buy from mixed reviews, and a scary low price. Initial notes are sweet, fruity, vanilla, but fresh and light. Not the teeny-bopper scent I was expecting from the Beibs, actually well balanced and decent performance. Wore it for about 6 hours before I noticed it was starting to fade. Awesome find. Let go of the stigma of buying celebrity fragrance and get this one! ",5

People are always asking me what I'm wearing, they love it. We were out with friends the other night and my husbands friend even ask me what it was. I think that says alot for a guy to ask, lol. I love this scent and I'm back for another bottle. ",5

600,"L'Homme Yves Saint Laurent Parfum Intense has a distinct smell that gets multiple compliments throughout the day. I am a fan and own the other Yves Saint Laurent colognes in the line, especially La Nuit, but this one almost rivals La Nuit for its unique scent that lasts a long time.",5
600,"L'Homme Yves Saint Laurent Parfum Intense is phenomenal. I purchased it as gift. He loved it right away, and it immediately became his favorite scent. As well as mine. I am a fanatic when it comes to perfumes and colognes ( I have about 30 bottles myself), but never did one captivate me to the point of writing a review. When he wears it, it makes me weak. Just buy it. It is sexy, elegant, romantic and classy. Wish it came in smaller bottles for travel. 100 stars!!!",5
600,"This is my favorite, long lasting scent from YSL. Highly recommend. ",5
600,"Yves Saint Laurent L'Homme Parfum Intense is a very nice scent. Definitely a sweet, sexy smell, a bit more flowery than many men's scents but still firmly masculine. Long lasting but not an overpowering silage. I prefer YSL La Nuit De L'Homme, but this one is definitely a worthy addition too.",5
601,"I got Wonderstruck as a gift and I love it. I am bedridden so I use it to make my room fresh. A few sprays in the air and it is perfect. And I adore the purple bottle! I love purple, so this fits the bill. I will recommend this scent for friends.",5
601,"Wonderstruck has been a favorite of mine forever! A lot of people say it doesn’t last, but mine last all day long.

605,"Donna Karan Cashmere Mist Aura; It smells like I walked I to Hollister, A&F, NY&Co. That high end and fine wood scent. I dig it! This is really a very nice scent. I can't see anyone not liking it. It's so neutral & comforting. It has that ""ISO E Super"" vibe to it. ""Aura"" is perfect suffix adjective to describe this scent. It really is like the soft whispy hairs on a lovely cashmere and angora sweater. It does start out with a blast of aldehydes but calms down to a balasmic, with a light airy floral. To be exact; Airy and soft then lower, deeper slightly floral vanillic sandalwood type notes. But yet at the same time, it is amazingly neutral, etherieal and transparent.",4
606,I love the scent of Emeraude. I wore this back in the 70's and glad to find it here at a very good price. The smell is soft and lasts all day for me. It is great for the Spring & Summer months. Thank You so much for having this available.,5

It was my husband favorite, & he bought it for me, every Christmas, Birthday, Mothers day & any time I ran low. He passed in 2017, so I have to find it myself now. I have been followed in stores, hospitals, hotels elevators, etc. Most of them stopped & asked me what perfume I was wearing, because they wanted to get some for their wives/girlfriends. I love it!!",5
606,I have loved Emeraude by Coty for over 20 yrs. & I still love it.I get so many compliments on it too!! ,5

610,This was a new scent for me... I like it. A bit Rosey but it's long lasting and clean. I think it's perfect for bedtime but not something I would want to wear while out and about. ,3
610,I love this scent and I appreciate the discount also and the delivery time. I will always recommend you. I am also enjoying pour un homme de Caron. Thanks,5
610,"Le Jardin De Monsieur Li. I was happy to find this on Fragrancenet as this is the only place I shop for perfumes for the past 3 years. They have the best selections and best prices. My sister got this as a gift and she let me try it. I love the smell and so does my husband. Since I bought this I also ordered other Hermès perfumes. They will make great Christmas presents. For the past 3 years I have been shopping fragrances at Fragrancenet for birthday, retirement, and Christmas presents for my female friends, family and coworkers. They are shock when they open their presents as these fragrances cost a lot of money elsewhere. With Fragrancenet you get the quality, great selection, best prices and fast delivery. ",5
610,"I had the tester since last Christmas and just decided to try it. OMG Le Jardin de Monsieur by Hermes is fragrance I wish I had tried when I received it a year ago.

610,Absolutely love this unisex fragrance. All of Hermes is amazing,5
611,So thrilled at how fast my order got here very pleased. And to top it off I blind bought this perfume and I don’t regret it at all. It’s so lovely. My favorite part of this perfume is when it sits on the skin for a while. It dries down to a soft feminine scent. And the longevity is even better on my skin. Don’t know if it will work well with every body chemistry. But it’s worth a try. ,5
611,Valentino Donna is a lovely floral perfume. Very elegant and classy.,5
611,Valentino Donna is SOOO AMAZING people!!! The notes in it are absolutely perfect! I am a person that tends to like more floral and musky fragrances and this is just perfect. It is very unique and can be worn any time. I love it so so so so much! ,5

614,"Jewel by Alfred Sung is just magical, I always get compliments all throughout the day. This perfume works so well with my body chemistry which is why it lasts all day. Don't be discouraged by the price I've come to realize that a lot of cheaper perfumes have much better scents than the higher branded ones.",5
614,"Jewel perfume for women is a beautiful, light airy scent! I have received so many compliments from my husband, friends and strangers, It was a new scent for me, love it and will definitely reorder. My only complaint is that the scent does not last all day but because I love it so, I find myself reapplying it often. ",5
614,"Jewel is a wonderful fragrance I have been using for years. It's a scent that I always get asked ""what are you wearing?"" It makes you feel pretty and clean. It stays with you all day. Definitely a keeper. Msprissy46",5

615,"I love Jil Sander No. 4. It's like a lighter version of Poison by Christian Dior, but I love them both immensely. Per the previous viewer, I didn't know fragrance samples (I assume she talking about the strips that you rub on your wrist) were prohibited from magazines. Talk about the minority always getting their way. If the sample strips bother you, don't smell them. I say bring back the samples in magazines! Anyway, I love Jil Sander No. 4!",5
615,"I am so so happy to see this perfume available again. Jil Sander #4 ,Love it ! Used it several years in Europe while I lived there and it is a luxury ,also I noticed it smells different in winter than in summer on my skin. I wish it would come as a tester tho , to save a bit. ",5
615,Jil Sanders #4 - My daughter have used it for over 15 years and it is her preferred perfume. It is very special and last for hours. A great perfume for a great lady.,4

616,"I bought Justin bieber's the key in a gift set, there's not been a purfume in his line I don't like! This is my favorite! Its flirty, sweet, and I always get loads of people asking what ate you wearing... And shocked when I tell them. Fragrance. Com has great prices on his line and many others. I'm very particular about my perfumes, if you Luke a sweet, lingering, attention getter, ...you'll love the key!",5
616,"Justin Bieber The Key is a fresh, clean, fruity smell that is long lasting! Cheap and smells amazing. It is not over bearing, light but able to be smelled. All of the Bieber perfumes smell great! I get compliments every time I wear them.",5

617,Ralph Lauren Blue The only cologne I wear I get so many compliments on it. 5 stars,5
617,Worn Blue by Ralph Lauren for many many years and have gotten numerous compliments on it scent. A lovely fragrance that last for hours without being overpowering. So happy I found it on this website as it is no longer being sold in our local stores.,5
617,I have worn Ralph Lauren Blue for years and to this day still get compliments. I was very upset when I couldn't find it on the shelves a few years back and was over joyed when I found it again. Please bring back the shower gel and the body lotion...............please!,5
617,I have been wearing Ralph Lauren Blue for a couple of years. I first gotten a whiff of the scent while at the physicians office where I work. A patient came in for an appointment and I was taken away by the scent. It felt as if my nose were stolen from my face chasing the scent! I had to ask “WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU WEARING”!? She was confused and I assured her that the scent was AMAZING. This scent is what I personally can ONLY refer to as “RICH”. Like the smell of a crisp UNUSED HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL! This is a scent I would expect a billionaire to wear. Honestly folks every scent is not liked by every individual. Some do not like the smell of fresh money or gasoline. Let’s face it... I’m a parfume junkie!!! I perchase expensive brands ONLY TO BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FRAGRANCE. THIS IS NOT ONE THAT DISAPPOINTS; IT WILL TURN ANY BAD DAY INTO A GOOD DAY WITH A BEAUTIFUL BREEZE ,5
617,I first purchased Ralph Lauren Blue for my wife about ten years ago and she still to this day gets women who either work with her or those that pass her on the side walk give her compliments. They even ask what is it or what name is it. I am very elated at her wearing it for so long and not getting tired of it. Great product,5
618,I ordered a sample of the Bond No.9 Wall Street just to see if I would like it. I love it! I get so many compliments. I will be purchasing my larger bottle as well.,5
618,Good perfume one of the best ,5
618,This fragrance has a weird but complex smell... The opening and dry down is the best part on my skin but some say that there's a wet dog smell in the heart which I didn't get but the seaweed note showed it's face for 30 minutes after that beautiful top faded away... Wall Street is ok but I suggest buying a sample first to see what notes you get on your skin.,3
618,Bond number 9 Wall Street Smells great. good for the office or hanging out. Nice and strong. ,5
618,"Smell different! I like it. I bought, two year ago, and I thinking in reorder, every body give me acompliments, when I used.",5
619,"Ed Hardy Hearts & Daggers and many more great products from this company, I have bought many over the few years and never had any problem's always great deals and very good prices thank you...",5
619,Never received Ed Hardy Cologne ,1
619,"The Ed hardy was a really good deal and really smells great, my wife love's it ",1
619,I found this on a whim one day for a steal and my husband loved it. I couldn't find it anywhere for cheap and I cannot fathom spending up to $70 in perfume/cologne. I stumbled across this site and I'm so happy I did. I bought 2 for my husband for his birthday and Father's Day. Shipping for reasonable and fast. I love this scent on my husband and I will definitely be ordering from here again. ,5
619,Great scent for a man's cologne. These scent classifications don't match what it actually smells like. It mixes great with a male chemistry unless your body odor is always pungent then maybe not the scent for you.,5
620,One of my favorites ,5
620,let me get itttttt,5
620,I just ordered Gucci Premiere and it is a lovely scent. It is not over powering. I have problems with some perfumes actually giving me a headache and others which have an unpleasant base note after they dry. I am very pleased with this scent and would buy it again. Very elegant. Just love this scent!,5

625,"Estee Lauder Private Collection.....I have been wearing this fragrance since the early 70's and only this one!!!! I have been sick of not being able to find anything to even match this lovely fragrance. Please keep it on the market. After reading other reviews I find many women feel the same as I do.....I'll be lost if they discontinue this fragrance. Trust me the investment will be worth it....too many of us ladies out there love this fragrance. Its the only ""ONE OF A KIND!!"" never to be replaced by another...impossible....Thank you!",5

For a new market I know it's a lot of marketing investment - but it will be worth it! Thank you ,5
626,"As a man one of the things I do is wear a cologne or EDT that is appealing to the opposite sex- which occasionally means I wear a cologne which was NOT marketed to men. Women ALWAYS compliment me and ask me what I'm wearing. This is one of the most complimented colognes I have. I wear it because women (and some men) don't expect this- a man who wears what is classified as a ""woman's"" cologne/perfume. I also wear CK Euphoria (the original) and women go crazy when I do. They love it. My other one is Shalimar (women's). Women LOVE a good fragrance...and for some reason cologne companies have decided a man is supposed to smell like a tree or like a bail of hay...which I've never understood. Poison, Shalimar, and Euphoria are my trio.... and I don't really care what other men might think about me wearing a ""woman's"" scent. I'm too busy slow dancing with the ladies who think I smell great. There ya' go.",5
626,I love love my perfumes ,4
626,Poison perfume is my favorite. This smell is always the perfect blend. ,5
626,"Poison is my all time favorite. For 27 yrs my husband, now passed, got me a bottle every Christmas. I ordered some today. He would have done the same.",5
626,"I always lived Poison but a little goes a long way. A great sultry nighttime fragrance, but I do wear it regularly during the day. It finishes nicely on me and becomes a powdery fragrance. ",4

627,husband loves it. simple.,4
627,"I actually bought Stetson for my husband as we have searched many stores I love it. He just smells so yummy! It is to me,a Cowboy, rugged, manly outdoor type. When he walks by when he first puts it on and walks by I tell him ""oh you smell so good"" Also he uses it lightly. I cant stand it when men seem to bathe in it.",4

630,"Tina B & anyone who isn't sure, this is the ""Gold"" bottle and an incredible scent, especially if you love Bergamot as I do, in every scent. Usually I'm not one to provide, ""Raving"" reviews. I'm sure there are others out there, such as myself, worried if they provide great reviews, then the product won't be available, when needed? You know who you are. Don't worry I don't blame you one bit. The reason why I provided this review today, is someone had the same question I had once, about the color of bottle. Why they don't advertise the bottle, is beyond me. Anyway, this scent, is absolutely incredible I actually prefer it over Gucci Guilty and Gucci Premier which I didn't think would be possible.",5
630,The delicate scent of Emporio Armani eau de parfum suite me fine.,5

It's so light and refreshing you will not offend anyone if you happen to wear it a little to heavy. It lasts for quite a while and mellows out nicely after application. I enjoy this scent so much that after running out it's only a matter of a few months that I have to buy another bottle it's so enjoyable. The price at Fragrencenet is so unbeatable. If you make this purchase for the first time, believe me you will love it also and it probly will become an instant favorite.",5

Man makes your nose do a double-take to recapture the surprise scent.. and it's Very unique--unlike many of the colognes that seem to re-imitate themselves. This one stands apart, and TALLER. I don't want to tell others what I wear when I exude this fragrance. Greedy, yes, but perhaps rightly so. It is a cologne one will not regret.",5
632,LOVE this scent. So happy that you sell it. Thank you! Il Bacio is very romantic both name and scent. ,5
632,"IL Bacio smells amazing i always get compliments. I have been wearing it since 2002 its amazing and is a must have for me. It last all day, I just love perfume and body sprays i have several but this is by far my favorite. ",5
632,"Il Bacio ""The Kiss"" i love this perfume. Ive had it since it was introduced in 93 and i only wear it on special occasions and it never fails to get compliments. I hope it never gets discontinued because its an amazing scent that just doesnt compare with others at all. Very unique...I definately recommend this perfume. I love Il Bacio...",5
632,I bought II Bacio parfum and cream in the tube. It smells like no other scents and I have quite a collection of various scents. I hope FragranceNet doesn't discontinue it. Borghese has made other scents in the past that have been discontinued that are also unique. If you like this scent buy plenty before it is gone. ,5
632,Amazing so Happy !! Thank you !! Will Order again :)),5
633,"I am a woman who never heard of this scent until I was in line and the man behind me was wearing it. How do I know, I had to ask him. He smelled so good that I had to know. I could've just inhaled him!! ",5

633,i love it when other people ask me what do i wearing....,4
633,Like many people I noticed the PS scent on another man and had to ask what the name of the product is. This is the cleanest fresh smelling cologne I have ever encountered. I have it in my line up now and it is by far my favorite. I have just today ordered the deodorant stick and I expect to be pleased with that too.,4
633,I have worn Paul Sebastian for years - I have always had people ask where to get it - one lady actually ordered it for her husband - would recommend the cologne as well!,5
634,Bvlgari Man is a wonderfully classic scent. Always get a lot of compliments when wearing it...from men and women.,5
634,In love with it all my ladies love it ,5
634,"Bvlgari Man, a masculine scent that is not overpowering. I feel this scent is for the sophisticated man and would be perfect for the office. This scent is growing on me but does not go with my personality. Great product other wise.",4
634,very nice elegant scent ,5
634,Getting so many compliments ,5
635,"This is beautiful!! Not too floral, tropical island feeling. Even my grandson commented on it. ",5
635,It lasts longer but I am not very pleased with the smell. I don't like the sandalwood in it I guess.,3
635,"I absolutely love this fragrance. Works great with my body chemistry, but doesn’t last the longest, but I don’t mind reapplying. ",4
635,Dolce garden is the best tropical fragrance I’ve ever smelled i love love love it .....my son really loves it too!!!.....best blind buy! ,5

636,Perry Ellis “Black”—-devilishly seductive. Vive la difference. Uniquely intriguing with staying power,5

636,Perry Ellis 360 black. My husband love it. ,5
636,"Received my order and while Perry Ellis 360 Black is nice, I was somewhat disappointed overall with the scent. It will not be my go to fragrance in the future and I probably will not order this again.",3
637,"Many compliments , best cologne ever",5
637,One the best cologne ,5
637,"I've been using ZZegna cologne for at least the past 10 years! I discovered it after the previous cologne that I had been using became extinct! The fragrance is mild, lasts many hours, and does not intrude into anyone's space. My grandchildren tend to say, ""Oh Grandpa is here!"" when I arrive at their home, even before they've seen me! For that reason alone, using ZZegna is worthwhile!",5
637,One of the best colognes I usually wear. Many compliments from both men and women is really high recommended .,5
637,"Zegna Z is this fruity citrus scent that smells good but does not project,too bad,I really like the scent.",3
638,"Not my fave. I thought it would be a little more exciting and fresh (like the Arancia and Cedra scents). Its very weak smelling and I don't like it. For the record I have the two above, plus Bergamotto and Fichi... ",2
638,"Acqua di Parma Ginepro de Sardegna Great fragrance. Great longevity and projection. This is a great fresh juniper fragrance that can be unisex, although I find it more masculine. Product arrived promptly and as described ",5
638,"Acqua Di Parma Blue Mediterraneo is the perfect scent for Los Angeles! Very versatile for all seasons and occasions! Fresh, clean, sofisticated without being over barring or pretentious! ",5
638,"Blu Mediterraneo ""Mandorlo Di Sicilia"" has been my fragrance for almost 2 decades. It is sweet, sultry, and sexy with luscious vanilla and oriental overtones. It dries down quickly to a non-invasive scent that leaves a wonderfully intriguing signature behind a woman (or man). I have allergies to almost every fragrance there is, but don't react to Acqua di Parma fragrances, so if you find wearing fragrance difficult, give this one a chance. I don't care for flowery fragrances, so this is a great, sexy alternative. I have always received wonderful compliments on this fragrance, from men and women alike, and always feel confident wearing it. A stylish and luxurious scent.",5
638,"Acqua Di Parma. Blue Mediterranean. Arancia di Capri Is a complex elegant frangrance which transports the senses. Alive, invigorating, happy, exotic, sultry, sensual and seductive. Whether used for business or formal the sensual musk is sure to put a smile on anyone's face who smells it.",5

639,"So far, I love both the lotion and the perfume, however; not one person has complimented me on the scent or asked what I'm wearing, but that won't stop me, it's my new go-to scent.",5
639,I love the smell of Euphonia body lotion. The scent is not overpowering and have had many compliments on this product! ,4
639,"Not even need to mention anything here, it’s my FAVORITE of all cream or parfum .. every where I go, people ask me what parfum I’m using, than I tell it’s The Body Cream Euphoria and as well the Euphoria parfum by CK.",5
639,"Euphoria lotion is the greatest scent ever and I get so many compliments when I wear it. Layering the body gel, lotion and perfume is just so delightful! ",5
640,Absolutely love Forever by Alfred Sung. It's a light fragrance that reminds me of spring flowers & sunshine. ,5

And I am in my sixties. All the compliments that I am getting when I wear it. Its a very soft and gentle scent. I love it.,5
641,"Blue Grass is one of my all time favorites, right up there with L'Aimant and Evening in Paris. Those fragrances are from another time and not esteemed today. But to me, Blue Grass evokes scenes from Katherine Hepburn movies. It is the scent of summer. . . lounging in the shade in an Adirondack chair sipping shandys. An overlay of lavender and orange blossom softens the spices. The hint of jasmine gives it push to be floral. I would rate it excellent except for its slight departure from the original Blue Grass.",4
641,"Elizabeth ARDEN's BLUE GRASS was a favorite of my Mother, and so I too just love it! It really reminds me of her, plus I receive many compliments when I wear it! It name says it perfectly......A fresh smell of the outdoors....Th $$$ price is GREAT!",5
641,"I first tried Blue Grass many years ago, and loved it. When I saw the great price on it I decided to try it again. It has such a light fresh scent, & guest I still love it, and the price",5
641,Blue Grass by Elizabeth Arden is my go-to summer fragrance. I’ve been wearing it for the past 40 years and I never get tired of the aroma and the fresh feeling it gives me. It is a perfect summer scent.,5

642,"Nice aroma, great gift",5
642,"After reading the description and reviews, I took a chance and ordered La Vie Est Belle. I don’t get any of the fragrance notes that are described. It smells like every other Lancôme fragrance, and is a little old ladyish, tbh. I’m giving it two stars just because it isn’t offensive. Expensive mistake that I won’t make again. Probably just going to give it away. ",2
643,OPIUM Forever !! over 40 years now I tried it from a tester at a very expensive Dept store the year it came out. My girlfriend said O we cant spend that much!! Never ever regretted it It is truly timeless ,5

643,"Back in the late 70's I had gotten a bottle of it as a gift and love the smell. It's mild and long lasting. It's not over powering. I love this perfume and planning on buying some this coming month, in June. ",5
643,"I have worn OPIUM since I was 18 now 63 - only scent I wear. I always get a comment on the scent and folks are often surprised when I tell them what it is - they have forgotten the scent. perhaps would be good to get the word out more, but then again i like being different in a crowd of scents!!!!! thanks ",5
644,"Britney Spears Private Show This is heavenly stuff. I adore this scent and now so does my mom. It's warm and inviting, projects nicely and has decent longevity of at least 3-4 hours. It's coffee, chocolate, citrus and dulce de leche on me and the price is steal on here.",5
644,"I LOVE this scent! I just finished a 1 oz. bottle, and am almost finished with the 8 oz. body spray. I just ordered a 3.3 oz perfume. This is the *1* perfume my husband absolutely cannot get enough of out of my HUGE perfume arsenal. I will ALWAYS have this one on hand! I'm 41, and I don't care! Britney made a hit with this one! I'm not really a fan of her others (with the exceptions of Midnight Fantasy & In Control Curious-those just smell sexy), but I love this, it doesn't have the teenage fruity vibe to it. GET IT!",5
644,"OMG this is good stuff! I am honestly blow away by this scent, from of all people, Britney Spears. I've found most of her scents to appeal to teens but not so much to mature folk but this one not only does that but can work for anyone, it's so yummy and comforting. I started with a sample and ordered full size the day after trying it on. It's got great longevity and sillage, it's a serious steal for this price. Thank you Frangrancenet for your deals and for keeping scents in stock that are otherwise hard to find.",5

645,"Uomo is a smooth unique scent it's not synthetic smelling which I love about it. Uomo smells like vintage soapy musk, high quality juice for the price. This has become my signature scent it's unique in offensive and versatile. Uomo comes in a classic presentation no disappointments what so ever, I will own this fragrance for life!",5

647,"I have love Dolce Gabbana Red for over 20 years, I get compliments every time I wear it. It has never been this expensive, I am sorry they are pricing themselves out of the market of so many people. I guess I will have to find a new fragrance, 150.00 is just to much, not even real perfume, it is cologne. Thanks Dolce for the last 20 years of good smells sorry to leave you behind. ",3
647,"I really love Dolce &Gabbana with the red top. I would definitely purchase this product, but it is too expensive. Use to wear it years ago; always got compliments. I red really pray the price is reduced!! Signed, Wisconsin ",5

650,"This is a beautiful oriental that is well made , spicy, soft, and long lasting. It smells rich and expensive. I detect a light peach note in the background that is soft and alluring, similar toTresor. Volupte is a fantastic value for the complexity of the scent and for the longevity. It is feminine and great for any occasion. Volupte rivals the highest priced perfumes and is a lovely classic.",5
650,"I discovered Volupte edt spray in 1996 & have been wearing it ever since. I have been known well for this beautiful fragrance particularly where I used to work as an Executive Support Officer to a high ranking Senior Director within the Qld Government.

650,"Volupte by Oscar de la Renta is a fresh, floral fragrance. Unfortunately my purchase was slightly damaged in transit, but not enough to go to the bother of returning it. I have generally found Fragrance Net to be satisfactory and good value, especially for the ""hard to find"" fragrances.",4

",5

I don't know what individual scent notes smells like so i can't really describe which is the most pronounced. However i'm just going to say that it smells very citrus-y. So if you like that sort of thing, give it a try. Another fragrance that i smelled that smelled of citrus was Creed Royal Water and this fragrance (Bond no 9 Wall Street) is way better than Royal Water....again IMHO.",5

665,"I really wanted to like this given it's long history as a well-belived, classic perfume. However, on me, this smelled overwhelmingly like cat pee with an undertone of baby powder. Maybe I got a weird batch, or perhaps it's just my skin chemistry, but this was a big no for me. ",1
665,"What a beautiful bouquet of flowers! Smells so very French, like walking in a flower garden in the morning. This is one of Ivanka Trump's favorite fragrances and wears it regularly. It is so unique and draws many compliments. Truly one of a kind! A+",5
665,"Very soft. I get compliments from men and women. It stays with you,We bought from an expensive name brand store. Your prices are waaay better",5
666,I'm going to order for women in husband's office. Is it boxed?,5

667,Tom Ford is SILENT AND SEXY!!!!! I love how it smells and lingers. It going to secure me some SERIOUS BROWNIE POINTS this Christmas ,5
667,I love Tom Ford has a smooth kind of casual scent that really comes across as a very manly scent and I've always gotten a lot of compliments when I wear that,5
667,"Tom Ford fragrance of the same name is suited for the every day man casual cologne subtle in scent it's multi facets of flowery,citrus/fruity and oriental/spice allows to use product whether for casual wear or evening of a black tie affair.",5
667,"Tom Ford by Tom Ford EDT A nice lite fragrance I like. The three star rating is because of the longevity. I spray 3 or 4 sprays and it lasts for half hour or so, then I have to respray. I can't keep a big bottle in my pocket when I go out. ",3
668,Vera Wang was very nice smells good cancel like it a lot makes people pay attention special lady,5
668,A nice clean scent,4
668,Vera Wang is awesome! It's light and smells great. Scent stays with you most of the day. Highly recommend. Will be buying more in the future. ,5
668,Vera Wang is a little tart at the start but within about 15 mins. Its turns into a classy cologne. Its soft and safe to wear in the office and out to dinner and close intimate settings like that. Longevity is not about 4 hrs or so on my skin and after that you have get real close to smell it,4
668,I agree...very nice mens fragrance..extremely sexy but longevity is poor...maybe 1 to 2 hours at most then becomes a skin scent..,3
669,"Angel is such a sweet and beautiful fragrance. I love it and have been wearing it for over twelve years and always get complimented on the fragrance by ladies and men. It is not an overpowering scent and I love the Body Cream,",5
669,Angel Body Cream is a super great product..leaves your skin silky smooth and smells so good. I am on my 2nd container. Love it,5
669,I love this cream it's so creamy and smells beautiful. Everyone always ask what I'm wearing,5

669,"The angel body cream was a great value. I’ve been wearing Angel for awhile now and love the scent, it last all day and I get many compliments. Will continue to wear for a long time.",5
670,"Bond Chez... This cologne provoked me to ask a man the name of the cologne, that's not like me, I'm not easily swayed by scents. Turns out after I started wearing it, other men wanted to know the name so they could add it to their collection. ""Smells like a million bucks"", is what I've heard. Highly recommended! ",5
670,Bond 9 Chez has to be one of the best fragrance in a long time. I only purchase Bond 9 products. The Chez and Lafayette i put those 2 together and you have a winner when you are around other people. ,5
670,You will not be disappointed with this purchase!! I hate wearing bc people always asking what it is and where do you get it from. Will forever keep a bottle in collection. ,5
670,Bond #9 Chez is a nice light smell! You have to experience it to know if you like it but my husband and I love the smell of this one!,5
670,Bond No.9 Chez is the best smelling cologne I’ve ever purchased. I highly recommend this to any man looking for that attractive smell. ,5
671,"I'm not sure what it's going to smell like on other peoples skin, but on mine when it dries down, it smells somewhat like incense. Don't let that scare you away though. This fragrance is absolutely great. I have smelled 6 different Creed fragrances and Himalaya is my 2nd favorite after Aventus. 3rd being Green Irish Tweed.",5
671,"So underrated creed, clean & fresh it smells GREAT! Love it 100% Authentic!! ",5
671,I own many creed fragrances and this is honestly a great fragrance. I receive compliments with this one all though you need to re-spray after about 4-6 hours.,5
671,"Love Creed, but hate paying Retail price! Found a place that can help me save money and send me the right stuff! Came packaged as you would expect from a department store. Highly recommend! ",5
671,"That’s my first time using this website and I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I purchased Creed Himalaya and it’s 100% authentic( I know because I’ve been buying Creed for 10 years), much better price than Creed store or any department store which sells Creed and very fast delivery service! I am very happy with the website! Thank you ",5
672,La Laque le parfum. I gave all the Lalaque fragrence as a hify to a dear friend of mine and I haven't heard from her yet as to how she likes the products and the sent. I myself at one time used the fragrence often and found ot delightful. ,5
672,"Lalique Le Parfum...I am still in the process of trying to get used to the pachouli and vanilla ingredients. I love jasmine and wish it were a little more dominant. I think I may eventually really like it, I hope. It is a bit sweeter than what I usually love. It is definitely a little more intense but it doesn't hurt to spread my wings a bit. Time always tells the tale. I am always pleased with the service and 99 9/10 of the scents that I have been able to order at a price far more reasonable than most department stores.",3
672,"The best parfume, I love ",5
672,"lalique le parfum i love it, ",5
672,Lalique le parfum. First time I have tried this. I was very pleasantly surprised. I like the mix. It was lite and fresh with a under tone of something else. The sent stays with you all day. ,4
673,"PERFECT SCENT!!! Acqua Di Gio is the final finishing touch to my summer wedding gear. Way too many words to describe this one so to keep it short & simple: ""I just love it!!"" I often question why the most gorgeous fragrances have to be so damn expensive but such is life. Giorgio Armani is the H.B.I.C of the fragrance kingdom. Translation: Head boss in charge for those unfamiliar with the acronym. ",5
673,"Je porte le parfum Aqua Di Gio depuis sa création en 1994, mais depuis qu'il a été discontinué par Armani il est très difficile de se le procurer. Heureusement j'ai trouvé sur ce site mon parfum. La commande a été simple et la livraison rapide. Excellent service, je le recommande à tous.",5
673,Acqua di Gio is the only perfume i wear and i get a lot of compliments on the fragrance. Thank you for still selling this one.,5
673,"This perfume (Aqua Di Gio) is one of my favorites. Every time I wear it I constantly get comments on how good I smell. Then I say to myself, I don’t smell anything. I love it and apparently it loves my chemistry with it. ",5
673,"ACQUA DI Gio is my favorite!!, and not only my favorite but everyone that gets close to me is asking me about what perfume am I wearing? with a pride I am telling them is Acqua Di Gio. I get this compliment every time,never fails. Mr. Armani please don't ever remove this perfume it would make me sad if you do. ",5

674,"Angel Innocent is something else! At first spray, I was able to tell it was a distinctive unique Fruity smell. This scent is out of the ordinary. 2 thumbs up! Like it a lot! ",5
674,I really bought Thierry Muglar innocent. It has the most seductive smell. And five star to fragnancenet excellent service everytime. ,5
675,"If you like a light scent this is not for you. It’s filled with seduction. Don’t need to spray a lot! The scent will make heads turn with the lightest of spray. If they don’t know you they will wanna get to know you. You become the interesting one in the bunch of two or three. The first date he wore a cute unisex scent I thought funny guy, smart. Second date he wore this and I thought handsome and yummy . He put his arm around me and this scent drew me to him. Armani Stronger with you cologne gets 5 lady stars from me. You will thank me later.",5
675,"savage by dior el mejor hasta ahora se la comieron . cuando llego todos me preguntan que"" perfume es ese""",5

676,Jaipur by Boucheron is one scent that I have never forgotten and I have been looking for it just everywhere except on line and now I know. I will be on here regular from now on. I will also be looking for my discounts from this site and hope the best for all that do use this cologne. This is one of the best cologne available.,5
676,"This is my ""go - to"" fragrance, and pretty well wear it daily. I'm not sure why, but I much prefer the Eau De Toilette over the Eau De Parfum. This fragrance is long lasting for me, and works well with my own scent. It never fails to gain compliments even from strangers, and will even mix it with a more woodsy toned fragrance for night time wear. One of my absolute favourites.",5
676,Boucheron Jaïpar Homme EdT is by far the most beautiful Fragrance I have ever experienced! And I've experienced a lot. Nothing comes close to this!,5
676,Smells great not overpowering ,4

679,Loooooove the scent but it may as well be body mist for $200+ dollars. The longevity is minimal. Definitely horrible for performance but the smell is stunning. I would opt for 'Intense' version! So bummed that this one was a flop! :(,1
679,It smells amazing!!! Buy a sample 1st. Make sure you like it. Its worth the $$,5
679,Our Wood is incredible and I recommend to any man who wants to turn heads everywhere he goes.,5
679,It’s an earthy scent that well compliments Tobacco Vanille. I love this fragrance!,5
679,"Wish i can give 6 stars for this spray,ladies love to smell from men",5
680,"Chloe Nomade eau de parfum is something special. Not a clone of all the candy-sweet popular scent. Just like the description says, but somehow the combination adds up to much more than the sum of its parts. It's perfect. I took one whiff and couldn't get enough of it. It's my new favorite.",5
680,Chloe Nomade eau de parfum is my favorite! The scent lasts all day & night. I’m always getting compliments! Male strangers ask what it is & where can they buy it for their lady! Excellent & enticing scent!,5
680,Bought this for my mother for mother’s day and had to go back to purchase a bottle for myself. It’s a very intriguing scent. I receive compliments from men every time I wear it. The dry down has a nice masculine smell to it. An Alpha female would enjoy this scent trust me!,5
680,"Chloe nomade is one of the best perfumes I have in my collection, there's nothing like this, it is unique and exquisite, receive a lot of compliments every time i wear it. ",5
680,Loved this perfume since the first spray. My husband absolutely loves this. He constantly hugs me and puts his head on my neck just to breathe it in. ,4
681,Purchased for my son ... as he walked pass me I said NICE... the young ladies are going to attack you ... be nice... love it,5
681,Absolutely love it a plus in my book. And my fiancé lives it as well so that's a 5Star for us both. Nautica sport is amazing and last long also very great deal from fragrance net and is hard to find in store. I highly recommend this fragrance ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,5
682,Prada Black is awesome!! Without fail every time I wear this scent I get compliments on how good I smell. Men stop me and ask what I’m wearing almost as often as the ladies. And the best part is how long it lasts. Great great scent!!,5
682,Nice scent. I like it my wife likes it only one big problem it dose not last long. What ever happened to colones. I use to purchase colones and it would stay with you most of the day. I tried toilette spray and that was a waste and now I tried this so called purfum a total waste. I don't mind spending for something good but this is a rip off. The name of the product I'm talking about is Prada Black. ,2
682,"Prada Luna Rossa Black- Let me begin by saying I have purchased all of the Luna Rossa scents. My favorites were the ""original"", and the ""extreme."" Based on the reviews, I was excited to purchase the ""black"" version. After receiving it, I realized it smelled very similar to the ""sport"" scent. I did not care for the sport scent, because it did not last very long on me. I was sad to discover that along with the scent, the life of the scent was the same. I was very disappointed with my purchase. Did V & R stop making the ""Extreme"" version? It is very hard to find.",1
682,I love it smells good ,5
682,Prada Luna Ross's Black is a great smelling cologne first time buying but will buy it again,5
683,I purchased this cologne for my husband for Christmas he loved and I loved it.,5
683,"Angel Men Pure Havana. I’m not a fragrance expert, but stumbled upon this while shopping for wife’s perfume. Frankly, I’ll sum it up in two words. Intoxicating and addictive. You’ll be smelling yourself all day!",5
683,I brought this one for my husband omg he love it,5
683,very good scent on pure havane never before smell anithing like that its call the attention to women even mens too thank you for provide me with that product pure havanne,5
683,Best scent I have ever purchased! Smells amazing on my man :) ,5
684,Bond No. 9 is one of my favorites,5
684,Hampton is one my favorite from Bond No. 9. ,5
684,Hamptons. Must be an acquired smell. Didn’t care for this one personally. Smells similar to melted plastic or that weird chemical smell when you break apart those cheap clear plastic key chains.,1
684,"Hamptons smells great, very similar to Creed SMW but less costly. The initial notes are a little different, but the dry down is pretty much spot on.",5
684,"Hamptons is a very fresh and inviting fragrance. Its very alluring on my man. I love it!!!!! It makes me want to attack him, lol!",5
685,My all time favorite smell. Ordered another one already. ,5
685,"My wife loved the scent on me. I immediately found it hauntingly familiar. The sweet vanilla was recognizable but something else in it alluded me. Many of those that have reviewed this product say it has a background of rubber. It must be the black rubber band around the bottle that suggests the smell to them because I don't agree. I know what rubber smells like; this is different. Though it does smell as if it comes from a man's environment. Months later I realized what the familiar scent was that Bvlgari Black kept bringing back to me. It's that of WD40 aerosol lubricant. It all makes sense now. I've heard many times that women are turned on when men build and repair things for them. When women smell this fragrance, they recollect moments when they were rewarded by a man's attention. ",4
685,Beautiful clean smell it reminds me of dreamer by Versace ,4
685,"Bulgari Black is as fabulous as ever. Wonderful scent. Woody, sensual and interesting. Love it. ",5
685,"I love it, I'm glad I could get this at the price. Thank you",5
686,"My Dior l’Homme just arrived; a TERIFFIC scent! I love the opening floral smell, which does not smell like a women’s scent, nor foes it remind me of ‘lipstick ‘, as some others have suggested!",5
686,I'm wearing this RIGHT NOW! Lol. I love it. Reminds me a little of DHI. (I need another bottle of Intense too)! ,5
686,"I love this product, it smells great ",5

686,Dior hommme smells clean and citrusy. The scent does not last more than a couple hours. ,2

688,"Bamboo, by Gucci, smells amazing! I had been looking for a new perfume in Sephora, and my boyfriend told me to try this one because he thought it’d be funny if I got something from Gucci, and we both loved it! It doesn’t seem to last *too* long, but I haven’t gotten a chance to wear it on a normal day, where I’m just hanging out or running errands. Much better price on this site though, so definitely worth buying here and not in stores.",5
688,I wanted to try something different. So glad I did. Gucci Bamboo is now one of my top 5 scents.,5
688,"Gucci does it again. Bamboo is a beautiful woodsy, floral and feminine scent that just makes you feel beautiful. Romantic and modern. I first received it as a sample and was hooked. ",5

691,"Encre Noire A L'Extreme by Lalique. may be the best value in the fragrance community. It is amazing for its price. It holds its own head to head against fragrance costing 10 times its price. If you are a man, you truly need this scent in your arsenal.",5
691,"Ordered based on a review look YouTube this one unfortunately this is really really bad smells of burnt wood, in a bad way. ",1

712,"Perry Ellis 360 RED! Bought this for my boyfriend. He said he wanted to venture out and try other scents, I don’t think so. I love nuzzling up to his neck and indulging in the scent. Although, a lot of women do compliment him on it too. Maybe I should switch it up?? ",5

The problem is, I used to be able to get the lotion as well when it was offered in stores, but I cannot find it on line and I am down to my last bit of it. I did get some from Ebay but it was unsealed and didn't smell right so returned it, I was so disappointed. Layering it with the perfume and the lotion is the way to go. Even if I just wear the lotion, people compliment me on it. This is a great scent! I wish someone in the states would import the lotion from Europe.",5

716,"I love all the Coach perfumes. I was given a bottle a couple years ago, and I'm finally starting to get to the bottom so I was trying to replace it. I thought I had picked the right Coach Poppy however I've since bought the Poppy Wildflowers and Poppy freesia, wouldn't you know that neither one are the same as the one I'm trying to replace, lol. But there's only one other option so I'll be getting it as soon as I can. But I do love Coach Freesia and Burberry Brit sheer so much that I've been trading them daily. ",5
716,Coach Poppy Freesia Blossom It came as described and I absolutely love it! I Would totally buy again!!,5
716,Thank you so much I’m loving the smell of it is so captivating ☺️☺️,5
716,"This was a blind buy for me, but I love the original Coach Poppy so I took a chance on Coach Poppy Freesia Blossom. The original Poppy is a refeshingly sweet and juicy scent that has the lightest floral splash to give it a sophisticated yet innocent personality, making it a perfect workplace perfume. Orginal Coach Poppy is an upbeat, subtly fruity/floral for those of us that aren’t huge fans of pungent floral perfume. I lean heavily toward gourmand, spicy, amber scents my favorites being Mugler’s Angel, Versace Crystal Noir, and even Katy Perry Meow. Getting to the perfume I am here to review, Coach Poppy Freesia Blossom, I was genuinely surprised by what my nose was telling me with this perfume. It was cozy and spicy and slightly sweet and very familiar. After a half day of reapplying and burying my nose in my wrist, I finally figured out why it was so familiar. It is VERY similar to Dior Addict. So similar, in fact, that it was jogging memories from 10 years ago when I bought my first bottle of Addict and wore it exclusively for about a year. So to make a long story short, if you are expecting a light, fruity floral, you are not going to get that from Coach Poppy Fressia blossom. It’s a lovely warm, spicy scent that is perfect for autumn. ",4
716,Love LOVE this perfume! Great switch when my previous go-to was discontinued. Lasts a long time and I received so many compliments!,5

737,"Halston Body Lotion.....I have used this product for over 20 years. After having trouble finding, the lotion, in stores near me....I was excited to find it with your Company. Thank you....from a very, Happy Costumer. ",5
737,"I wore Halston to two proms way back in time, circa 1968. It is timeless and just so beautiful. Try the body cream - it seems to scent the body in a soft and lasting way. Yes, I have had the spray cologne - but, I'm here to say this lotion is really ""thee bomb."" Lastly- currently and in my much younger days men really liked this scent. It is five star for sure. Fran in, California",5
737,LOVE halston body lotion and perfume. But lotion is my FAVORITE. Have used it for over 25 years. Get lots of compliments since scent is not overpowering like some others. It's been almost impossible to find lotion in larger 6.7 ounce size. Hope they are still making it. Nothing I have tried compares to Halston body lotion. J,5
738,Smells great just wish it lasted longer ,3
738,"The more I use DRR, the more I like it. It has a wide range of notes and changes significantly from first application to final farewell. Some days it smells like gasoline, some days it has a more floral edge. At first I thought it didn't last, but a subtle ghostly scent lingers for a long time. I just ordered a second bottle, that's how much I like it.",5
738,Smells like Dark Rebel with more of a leather scent. Nice and dark. Decently long lasting also 4-6 hrs,4
738,"JV Dark rebel rider..sensual for sure, leather swirling around the amber smoke, walk in the woods and experience the earthy floral touches at first, but this beauty morps into something special, may have need to reapply, but why not! mixed reviews from some but its a masculine night ride home, unique and classy in that John Varvatos tradition, this one is a keeper! ",5
738,"I'm absolutely enjoying this amazing scent with my personal chemistry - great, subtle presence. A definitive winner. ",5
739,Yes I like my Wings. The lotion smells good. Glad it’s the real lotion and not a knock off. Continue making the products and meet the needs of your customers... Thanks ,5

755,What a great deal! Excellent and unique and on clearance!,5
755,"Horizon by Guy Laroche is a really, really good scent. If I had to choose a signature scent, Horizon would be it. It smells fresh and clean and expensive at the same time. It has woodsy and juniper notes that remind me of sitting in an expensive wood-paneled home library during the autumn months wearing a satin jacket and smoking a pipe with great-smelling pipe tobacco. Yes, it smells affluent and opulent. I'm so glad I found Horizon on FragranceNet because Horizon has become increasingly more difficult to find. At this price, every man who loves Horizon has not reason not to stock up on it. I love wearing Horizon mostly in the autumn and winter months, although the grapefruit note lends itself to be appropriately worn in the spring and summer also. I also love Horizon's big brother, Drakkar Noir, which is an herbal all-season great fragrance! Thanks, FragranceNet, for carrying Horizon and the accompanying Horizon soap with accompanying box. Horizon is a quality fragrance and the soap is high-quality, highly-fragranced milled soap that will make your bathroom smell wonderfully fragranced. What a masculine and very appealing one-of-a-kind men's fragrance from the house of Guy Laroche! A+ all the way!",5

758,"Aqua Allegoria Pamplelune is a mouthful to say, but a wonderful light, citrusy fragrance. I’ve worn Guerlain fragrances since my teens, and when I was in Paris I made my pilgrimage to their shop. This is one of what I call summer scents. It is refreshing and definitely worth every cent. ",5
758,I was a bit apprehensive after reading all the bad reviews on fragrance net but I was pleasantly surprised by the product ,4

761,Boucheron perfum is the best ,5
761,"I just love Boucheron. I ran out years ago and I wasn't able to replace it because it was so expensive. After visiting your web site I was able to buy 2 bottles, very reasonable. I am very sensitive to smells. Perfumes give me headaches but Boucheron works for me without making me sick. After I ran out I was without any perfume for over 10 years. Nice to have my scent back.",5
762,my sons loved this new scent....thank you.,5
762,"This is a good cologne to have if you enjoy the Curve line. It is a romantic yet anytime wearing cologne. I sprayed it on at approx. 7:30am and the scent lasted half way through my work day, approx. 5 hours (it faded slightly). If you would like to make it last longer, you may need to re-spray during the day, possibly after your lunch hour. other than that, it is a very pleasing cologne and would definitely buy it again. I use it as my back-up cologne and keep an extra bottle at work.",4
763,Hugo Energise - Been using this product for 12 years now and I’m glad I found Fragrancenet because they have a lot of good offers. Very Happy customer here. ,4
764,John Varvatos Artisan Pure is awesome! Fresh crisp clean smell that’s great for warmer weather but would probably do ok anytime. I wish it lasted longer as I only get 3 or 4 good hours then it’s basically gone but other than that it’s great. ,5
764,"This version is the best interpretation of the ""Artisan Line "" . This is just not a flanker! It's a step above the original. The original masterpiece that is Artisan will always be my favorite. But you could not wear it in the warmer weather. ""Artisan Pure"" is the answer to that!!! ",5
765,"Bought this one blind, and I’m not disappointed. It was meant to be an everyday versatile fragrance for me to not have to overthink what I want to wear everyday. It will surely serve its purpose. I can’t say it’s the most attention grabbing or compliment driven scent but it’s good for your average everyday fragrance. Not a special occasion grab or anything. ",4
765,"I just received a bottle of the mon Guerlain. I bought it blind after reading reviews and fragrance description. I am an avid collector of fine fragrances, and especially like Guerlain fragrances, such as 68 and the aqua allegoria collection. Unfortunately, Mon Guerlain is a total DUD. Blah, nothing special about it at all. Smells like every other boring fragrance that can be had. Unfacetted, I can’t distinguish any endearing notes. If you want something special.....move on and find something better. ",1
765,"I ordered an ‘open box’ bottle of Mon Guerlain for a fairly good price. My fragrance arrived very carefully wrapped in shrink plastic, it had the batch number at the bottom, the fragrance lasts at least four hours which is what it normally lasts on my skin, and it looks perfectly good. I ordered an open box expecting something sub-par and i was pleasantly surprised to receive a perfectly good bottle of Mon Guerlain.",4
765,This perfume is the best ever. It smells soooo good.,5
765,"I purchased Mon Guerlain parfum after smelling it at a department store. It's very soft yet strong enough for others to smell it and like it. Because it's a parfum, the scent will last. I think it's very sensual since men seem to compliment me the most with this one. Try it- you'll love it!",5
766,Parfumerie de Marley Delina I love this scent on me. It’s worth very penny. ,5
766,"This is my first purchase from the Parfums De Marly house and I went with Delina. Oh my, what a absolutely gorgeous Parfum! Very feminine and unique. I personally have never smelled anything like it before and I will be purchasing more from this elegant brand again. It lasted a long time on my skin and I was very pleased with that. I have been sick and tired of spending so much money on parfums that do not perform very well and I think this one is a winner!",5
766,So disappointed in this one... it smells exactly like Good Girl by Carolina Herrera. Save your money and purchase that one instead. It smells great by thought it would be completely different.,2

768,"I purchased 8 different sample perfumes for about $20 and this one is my new favorite! Amor Amor by Cacharel was my go-to fragrance for the past 15 years and I could never find something I really loved until now. “The One” is simple, sexy and clean My boyfriend also smelled the 8 sample perfumes I purchased and he also chose the Dolce Gabbana perfume sample too. It’s a winner :)",5

777,Excellent cologne. I have used for several years. Still love it.,5

778, I've been using Vanderbilt lotion and Perfume for 39 years now and cannot say enough about these products. I can always depend on having this around by ordering online rather than spending alot of time and gas driving all around town hoping that your favorite store hasn't run out of it. The best of all times is Vanderbilt.,5
778,"I ordered 2 Gloria Vanderbilt lotions & could not be happier! The price, for this hard to find lotion, was great & shipping was reasonable & super fast! I definitely recommend Fragrancenet! ",5
778,"Vanderbilt lotion is the best-- been using it for decades. Never stop making it, please.",5
778,"This is my go-to product for moisturizing face and body. I have been using it for over 15 years and am very satisfied with the results. The original product was packaged in round plastic pink containers, similar to the eau de parfum. However, I believe the contents are the same or similar. Gloria Vanderbilt body lotion",5
778,"I ordered the Gloria Vanderbilt perfume and lotion, very pleased with the products.",5
779,"Prior to purchasing Aqua Marine, I was an avid fan of Bvlgari's Aqua Amara. Being that this is another Aqua flanker I figured it would be similar. Glad I bought it! Refreshing, light, aquatic that lasts! Now I just need to get the original Aqua Por Homme! Great blind buy if you love aquatics. ",4
779,Have yet to receive this item... C Ray Allshouse,4
779,"I've always had a difficult time finding a cologne I like. Usually, I just finding them too overpowering or they give me a headache (especially sweet ones like Fahrenheit). I recently discovered aquatic fragrances but still struggled to find one that didn't turn my stomach. Then I found Bvlgari Aqva Marine. I love this scent! A very fresh scent and a little briny, which I like. My only complaint is the short longevity; it seems like it's gone before it even gets going but maybe that's just on me. I recently tried Aqva Amara and, somehow, it's even fresher smelling than Marine and it lasts FOREVER (at least twelve hours)! ",4
779,"I like the scent; it's citrusy with some sweetness, has the sea salt that I love (though barely detectable to my nose), but it definitely doesn't have the same intoxicating, darker scent that Aqva has. If you like sweet, fruity aquatics, try it. If you like more citrusy aquatics with a hint of sea salt or want an authentic beachy scent, go with Aqva.",4
779,"My husband has this fragrance and he just likes it....I LOVE IT! For Father's day, I gave my dad the gift of Bvlgari Aqua Marine and he LOVES it! I love the subtleness of it. What was nice was that I did not realize I got a huge disk for the same price as my husband's smaller one. Fast delivery. Easy order process.",5

780,I just love this cologne I used to buy it all the time when I was in Las Vegas,5
780,"I love it. Just today I was paying my bill at a Restaurant. One gal who I see a lot there said I looked really nice. One other gal said ""And he Smells Good Too."" All in a day of wearing Caesars for Men. ",5
781,Girl of Now is a gorgeous blend of gourmand and florals. The pistachio and almond notes are amazing and helps cut through the sweetness. Perfect for any occasion and season not to mention how beautiful the bottle is. ,5
781,Love this Perfum!!!! It’s so soft & sexy ,5
781,The Girl of Now is a very nice fragrance!!! It reminds me of a beautiful day on the Costa Rican beaches of the Peninsula of Papagayo!!! Such a refreshing yet warm smell of tropical goodness!!! It lasts all day!!! I definitely recommend this fragrance!!!!!,5
781,"Ellie Saab ‘s Girl of Now is possibly my new signature fragrance! Love this warm, sweet inviting scent. Unlike anything else I own. Easily worn day and night , or any season! ❤️ ",5

782,Glow is the only fragrance that I have worn for many years. It is light and refreshing. I receive many compliments on the scent and people comment on how very clean it smells. I was happy to receive the set. ,5
782,I love JLO GLOW perfume!! I wish the lotion can be bought by itself!! please make lotion to be bought by itself!! I know other women who feel this way too!! ,5
782,I love Glo more than any other scent I’ve worn in my (long) lifetime. I have worn it for many years. I wish they made/sold large tubes of the shower gel and lotion. The small ones in the sets seem to be the only ones available and they go fast. LOVE this scent!,5
782,"Bought 3 boxes combinations of Glow, love them every minutes of it when I put them on me, I am so glad I finally found which perfume fit on for me and intend to order always",5
783,Amazing soft and sexy scent.,5
783,"Very Lovely smell. Soft, sensual and long lasting? Just like a sweet kiss?",5
783,"I got given this scent from my sister who deemed it too ""unlike"" her. A definite softer side to the Rihanna collection, compared to rebel fleur which has a sort of wild side to it. Great for everyday use, a soft but alluring scent that hangs and leaves a lasting impression. My friend always says I smell ""so good"" whenever I wear this, and she even smelt it throughout the workplace ages after I had been walking around! If you want a scent that leaves a soft, yet tantalising and delicious path - this is perfect. ",5
783,Nude...an everyday fragrance.. very nice.,5
783,I bought the mini bottle of Nude to try and see if I'd like it. Not a bad fragrance at all. I'd say this is perhaps a softer side of RiRi that she wishes to reveal as compared to Rebelle & Reb'l fleur which are sort of wild and sexy. Great for the office or sometimes for church and shopping.,4
784,I have been wearing Amor Amor for year's and it's my go to it always has been. I receive so many compliments and when I use to sell it at Dillard's we couldn't keep it in. I was shocked to hear that it had been discontinued so I'm so greatful that fragrancenet carries it.,5
784,Amor Amor is my daughters favorite and for such a great price and free shipping I bought 2 for her birthday it came earlier then expected she’ll be so excited thank you ! ,5

786,Escada Agua del Sol - light & lovely summer scent. One of my favs.,5
786,Escada agua del sol is very delightful fragrance!!,5
786,"Escada Agua del Sol is a fabulous scent for the summer! Its top notes are definitely mango and palm (with a slight floral middle note) and as soon as you spritz some on, you'll feel like you're on a sunny tropical beach. It's fresh and youthful without being too young (I'm 51 ",5
787,"I love this, first time trying the Oud Great..",5
787,"John Varvatos Oud, this was a blind purchase and made it based on its ingredients which are good quality. This is a very strong woodsy parfum and lasts a very long time, do not over spray this. Great price and very strong and bold smell. ",4
787," John Varvatos. Oud. I just received it and I'll admit I was little bit apprehensive buying this on a blind buy. One of the best purchases I've made, the smell is so unique smelling it just grabs your attention ",5
787,"John Varvatos Oud is simply amazing, I recieve compliments all day long, it´s classy and elegant, I love Oud Fragrances and this one is one of the best Oud Fragrances in the market, I also have in my collection the one that for me is the best Oud Fragrance that is Royal Oud by Creed, but this one is an excelent choice if you want to save a lot of money and believe me it is exquisite, thank you John Varvatos!!!!!

787,This is an amazing perfume. Smells good and long lasting. I'll recommend to anyone. 5/5 rating for me. ,5

789,"Ohhhh how delectable this one is! My signature winter fragrance. Angel muse is beautiful and soft compared to its sister Angel. I’ve always loved Mugler’s original Angel until I encountered this one. Muse is much sweeter, it smells intoxicatingly like creamy caramel, chocolate and vanilla with that undertone of earthy patchouli. Normally not a patch fan but in this it’s just the right amount to make it smell wonderful. Love love love!!",5
789,"I love this fragrance, it's my ""Signature Fragrance"".",5
789,Janice Ramos Gee Love it Love it! Another Lovely Fragrance it smell like original Angel but different with more vanilla nutty scent just Beautiful ,5
789,"I just received a third order of Thierry Mugler, Anagle Muse. I love the fragrance , I wear it throughout the day. I wish it lasted longer. It could just be the way it reacts with my body, but a little spray takes care of that. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a fragrance you can wear all day.",5

790,Really good! I like it.,4
790,"This is my all time favorite fragrance! I constantly get told that I smell ""so good"" and asked what fragrance I'm wearing. I would describe it as light, soft, flowery, yet fresh, with a hint of citrus and vanilla. I hope they never stop making it!",5
790,"I totally agree with Justine's review here. This scent did not shock me one bit,but the bottle is definitely a keeper. I'll use it for refilling with those vintage cologne splashes that people in my grandparents' time wore. A bit disappointed in this one.",3
790,Ck one shock is nice. I was expecting a powerful scent inside the bottle. Seems like the name is quite misleading as the scent is pretty light and fresh. I still have the 1.7 bottle I got for Christmas last year and a little bit left so I might probably buy the bigger bottles for refilling. A great everyday scent to wear anytime. ,3
790,"It smells really good. It comes in a nice milk white, glass bottle. It smells like citrus and it's perfect for a teenager. I'm really happy I got. If I ran out I would buy it again",5
791,Great starter Oud fragrance... great alternative to Dior Oud Ispahan on the dry down.,4
791,"Outstanding fragrance without being overpowering. I have been very pleased with every Franck Olivier fragrance I have purchased. Each has a subtle masculine scent that gets comments every time I wear them. This was my first ""Oud"" style fragrance and I am happy I chose this one. Would like for it to be a longer lasting scent but is great for an evening out.",5
791,"I know I say this every time I review a Franck Olivier fragrance, but this house needs more attention. A great oud / rose scent. It's masculine and projects well. Really truly can't say enough about this house for the price point. Not synthetic and not the same old mass-appealing DNA. If you like something different and niche, you need to try this one!",5
791,Franck Olivier oud touch is exactly that's I'm looking for unbelievable you will love it 100%,5
791,"Franck Olivier Oud Touch is a pleasant-smelling fragrance. Upon my first encounter out of the box,this fragrance was leading the pack. As time went on,I did come to realize this choice lacked slightly in perseverance(it faded a bit prematurely for my taste). It works for short encounters but might not be my choice for the entire day,per say. I would not advise against it because it's fragrance is pleasant regardless of staying power.",3
792,What a pleasant surprise! This is a wonderful scent for spring and summer. I have had several compliments. Give yourself a little gift.,5
792,I like the Cabotine Rose. Although it is very light fragrance & I don’t smell very strong Rose fragrance either. Carol G.,4
792,"I had recently tried the other cabotine perfume and liked it so much I decided to try this! Its very pretty, rose scent that is light and fresh. I really like it. I have enjoyed trying new scents lately and you can not beat the prices. Very nice fragrance for the summer.",5
792,Alway love it (Cabotine Rose ,5
792,"I bought it for my daughter, great price , very pleasant soft and fresh scent. I am very happy with my purchase. Kim Montreal",5
793,Outstanding. Great balance of citrus and forest.,5
793,"Still a fantastic fragrance and VERY Unique, this is a true classic that is as contemporary as it has always been for a class act man. You can wear it at the office, or for a night out!",5
793,"Dior Eau Sauvage EDT- The initial opening of this fragrance is fresh with a lot of citrus notes. I could see myself wearing this everyday in the summer if the initial scent had some staying power. Unfortunately it doesn't, at least on me. Within a couple of hours there's nothing left to enjoy. I'm kind disappointed because I read a lot of positive reviews and had high hopes. I get the same performance from another well known French boutique store's Cedrat EDT. So for me I guess this is just typical performance from citrusy fragrances. ",3
793,"Best, most usable fragrance for either men or women. In the early 1970s, a girlfriend of mine had a large bottle at home and we used to wear it often. To this day it takes me back to my carefree youth. I am constantly complimented to this day. It's the only fragrance my husband likes.",5
793,"i haven't received it yet, two weeks after it was sent. can't help here.",5
794,"Guess Seductive Homme Blue is a very nice clean fragrance that is safe and will not offend people. It last a good 6 hours on my skin. At this price point, is hard to beat specially if it's scent is similar to YSL L' Nuit! So I've been told.",4
794,Guess Seductive Homme Blue is hard to fault. It's not the best out there but I don't think you'd find many people who don't like it. I wear it on casual occasions - a little smells great - a lot is way too overpowering. Good but not great.,4
794,It's Ok for casual purpose and going out.,3
794,"Guess Seductive Homme Blue is worth trying and certainly at this price point. I wear various fragrances, but this one gets my wife's attention. Smells great and last several hours.",3
794,"I bought this cologne for my hubby and he loves it. Great to wear anytime, anywhere.",5

795,"Love the Must De Cartier perfume. I have used it before and ran out a while ago, found it on the this sight and ordered it immediately. The fragrance is wonderful, and I like the Must as it seems to linger longer than other perfumes Would recommend this perfume to anyone who likes the ""must smell"".",5
795,Must de Cartier is a fabulous fragrance which I adore. I can hardly wait for February 3rd to open my birthday present. Enjoy ordering from you and love the price. A great perfume at a great price. Now don’t go up on price because of comments. ,5

798,"I have been looking for ""BURBERRY SPORT"" for year's & I couldn't find it. Well I found it right here & immediately ordered it. The bottle was a great size, which made me so happy! I am completely happy with this purchase! A great deal! Thank you",5
798,Loving it very much getting compliments from all over the place thanks ,5
798,"I can't stand strong or overly sweet fragrances but Burberry sport is neither of those things. It's a very refined but gorgeous scent which is least overpowering & I think anyone can wear it. No matter what the occasion is,this fragrance will not only enhance your personal style but make people take notice and you're sure to get positive comments about it. It worked for me,so why not try it yourself. ",5
798,This burberry sport smells amazing.. I didn't regret buying it at all everyone I know who smells it ask me about it... Smells awsome ,5
798,"I got Burberry sport as a gift and it is an intriguing scent. Definitely a grown woman's aroma,and fantastic bottle design. I'd much rather use this for a fancy evening out instead of the daytime. ",5
799,"CABOTINE I LOVE THIS PRODUCT THE SMELL IS AMAZING, YOU MUST HAVE ADD THIS TO YOU COLLECTION",5
799,"I ordered Cabotine De Gres lotion, shower gel and spray having never smelled it. To my surprise, I like it. I layer all three scents. It has a nice fresh scent - it does not over power. I am going to try Gold next. Great price! Good choice for me as it doesn't give me a head ache. ",5
799,I love Cabotine De Gres - being using it for many years - get lots of compliments from men and women. My bedroom is fragrant with the scent although I don't use it everyday. I plan to give gifts to friends and family. Thank You ,5
799,"I love this Cabotine De Gres Eau De Toilette Spray that comes with a 3.4 oz Body Lotion & 6.7 oz Shower Gel. I smelled it on my sister a few months ago and was won over. This fragrance is so fresh; however it goes on strong but wears down so a little goes a long way. I was not in love with the lotion, but I layer so the two go together well. I would recommend you put it on at least 30 minutes to 1 hour before you leave so it wears down perfectly. It last all day and it leaves a freshness in the air/room. ",4
799,I had been unsure of trying Cabotine but kept going back to reread comments and product information. So glad I took a chance and I love it!! It's a classic scent soft but bold. I scent stayed on for a long time. Don't miss out on Cabotine!!,5
800,"I first bought Calandre for my wife in 1971 when my daughter was born. She has been using it since then. The only other perfume she has used consistently since those days is Joy by Jean Patou. It is compatible with Calandre. My wife still gets asked about her perfume, as Calandre is unlike any other she has tried. Your ordering and delivery services are excellent and unmatched in my long experience. ",5
800,My favorite perfume not found elsewhere but at Fragrancenet. Very smooth transaction and timely delivery!,5
800,"paco rabanne calandre, excellent product and service.",5
800,"I discovered Calandre in Europe when I was 26 and bought back home as much as I could. I have been wearing it off and on since then, and I'm almost 70 now. I was so sad when it was discontinued, and now so thrilled I can have it again. I love this fragrance and at this point, it's part of my identity. People often comment on it, and ask what it is. I'm happy to say, because I always want to be able to get it!",5
800,I have worn Calendra since 1970! It was given to me as a Christmas gift. I wish the powder and cream were available it hasn’t been for years in fact Calendra disappeared for some years. I wear it everyday and it has become my scent. I forget that I am wearing Calendra until someone stops me and inquires about the name of what I am wearing. You would be surprised how many men young and senior who have stopped to ask what I am wearing.,5
801,"Calvin Klein Man is not my favourite of my 20+ fragrances (which includes Chanel, Hermes, Mugler, Dior, JPG, etc) but it is a very well-rounded workhorse scent which lasts through my 16 hr sweaty workdays while still subtle enough for sensitive co-workers first thing in the morning. It starts off light and pleasant and stays the exact same for 18 hrs, doesn't fade, doesn't sour, doesn't change. The scent itself isn't as much citrus as described but more of a warming, aromatic and spicy enough to blend perfectly with my skin yet clean and doesn't end up smelling like flavoured sweat. The only reason it's not my favourite is because of personal scent preference, however CKM performs amazingly well and I wish my other frags scored this high on staying power and suitability for work. I paid $60 for my bottle and considered it well worth the money but now I find it here for even less so I'm obviously buying from Fragrancenet when I need CKM again",5

801,good cologne and fast delivery CALVIN KLEIN MAN,4
801,"I've been using this scent for almost 10 years. It's a staple... my friends know me by this cologne. It's a perfect balance of fragrance without overpowering. It lasts all day and night. I've never had anyone say anything bad about this scent and I'm in sales. In front of new people everyday, thousands of noses have whiffed this blend and again, no complaints. Until I found fragrance net, I was paying huge box store prices for the SMALLER bottle! Never again! My order shipped proptly, I was well notified, and the cologne came well packaged. ",5
802,"WOW!!!! What can I say about Coty Cologne , a person has to wear it to know how the scent is . I get lots of complemented on the scent. I have been wearing it for ten years, and never, but never get tired of the scent . ",5
802,I received my cody musk which is one of my favorites on time and at a good price and in this case it was free shipping. It's the wonderful product that it always is. But I do not understand why I ordered Paul Sebastian which I have on several occasions and it does not smell like Paul Sebastian maybe it's old stock or maybe it's a copy I don't know but it has a different smell completely it's not bad but it's not the Paul Sebastian that I like that is why I no longer ordered that I tried several times and it's always the same it just does not smell like Paul Sebastian that I buy in the department stores here but of course it's more expensive here. So that I've not been pleased with but as far as the Musk and this is the only type I like I do not like to Jovan at all I like Cody Musk and I will continue to purchase that from you when I can get a good deal and maybe free shipping because I can get it for about the same price here and have it the same day and no shipping charge so I have to keep that in mind. But I am very happy with the product that I received from you every time when I order it I just wish I could say the same for the Paul Sebastian. But thank you for your online store I enjoy shopping here. Scotty Morgan,5
802,"My father wore this scent from before I was born. He had put it on the morning before for he died. It's such a wonderful masculine scent. It's also a warm caring,tender,cozy and loving scent.

It’s still an excellent fragrance that comes at a reasonable price. I highly recommend this fragrance.",5
809,"I’m on my 3rd bottle of Dunhill Desire Red (there is a Blue also). I love the smell. There is a note in it, maybe vanilla, that makes it a really attractive scent.

810,"F by Ferragamo Pleasantly surprised by this offering by Ferragamo. Clean, fruity(it reminds me more of raspberry than apple) with a very nice dry-down and not too expensive which makes it an exceptional value. I will definitely purchase this again.",5

811,Geir Ness is a fantastic cologne I am always getting compliments and asked what are you wearing. Won’t use anything but Geir Ness.,5
811,"Like many people, I found this scent at Epcot in Norway a few years ago. You can't find it anywhere else (the real thing) except here at FN. It has a nice, clean, fresh scent and for some reason, it drives certain women wild! Needless to say, I get many compliments on it and women will actually stand close to me just to smell it!",5
811,I found Gier Ness for Men in 2003 while on a trip to Epcot Center. I tested it and was a little interested. Once I had many comments on how good I smelled by women of all ages I went straight back to the beginning and bought it! My wife continually smells my neck followed by a little Kiss. I have used it since and love it.,5
812,Perry ellis reserve. I’ve used this product for years and get more compliments from the ladies than anything I have ever used before. I highly recommend this product. Don’t buy the small bottle because you will use this a lot. ,5

813,"Un Jardin Sur Le Toit EDT is a fresh scent and very suitable for the Spring and Summer seasons. This is an authentic fragrance and an easy buy due to its great deal. I bought this in 2017 and had it for a year until I gave it away to my grandma. She loved it so much, so I gave it to her as a gift and early birthday present. The longevity is medium (about 3 hours) but the scent is amazing and unique. This smells grassy mixed with oceanic ""fresh"" and fruity apple, a lot! I am a male and buy female fragrances to spray on money gift envelopes for my girlfriends. Overall, this fragrance is a 3.5 out of 5 due to its performance but its Top, Heart, and Base notes makes up for it. 5 Stars Why? The fact that this fruity and oceanic makes it a nice purchase.",5
813,"In Jardin Sur Le Toit - fresh and feminine fragrance, neither floral or fruity. I’m 100% satisfied! It’s strong enough and even after 8or 9 hours at work I still can smell it. The most exiting thing about the fragrance is I can’t smell any particular note -just complex of them! People around me are intrigued too. I have a lot of compliments. The price and quick shipping are worth to be mentioned too.",5

813,Un Jardin Sur Le Toit fragrance is simply the sexiest and most beautifully seductive perfume ever formulated....men gush over how alluring this fragrance is on women....love it!,5
814,The crystal noir perfume is more of a floral and not spicy in my opinion; still a beautiful scent! The toilette has the spice and coconut base where as the perfume does not! Both great scents! Although fragrance net didn’t send me a free sample of perfume like last time ,5
814,"Hello Everyone, This is the best perfume to buy when you spray it on you don’t smell it much, however everyone you walk pass or enter a room they smell it.

815,I love this product.I think every ♂ should own a bottle ,5
815,Decent cologne just too woodsy for me. I was expecting a richer fragrance based on the reviews...definitely for evening wear with a suit or tuxedo not for wearing to work or a BBQ. Decent fragrance not great,3

819,Omg wow I've never smelled something so sexy in my life this is an amazing fragrance and I'm so happy I bought this for my lady! Thank you Yves Saint Laurent!,5
819,"First, this is a lovely, long-lasting scent that is slightly sweet, feminine, and not at all cloying or cheap smelling. I love it. I've worn Mon Paris before and this Couture version isn't much different--I detect a little more of a sparkling note, and of course, the bottle has a slightly different bow, but otherwise, it's roughly the same. This was also my first purchase from fragrancenet and it was excellent all around--super fast shipping, brand new bottle in unopened packaging, obviously authentic, and great price. ",5
820,"Ok..so i just got this Boss in Motion and sprayed for the first time. Last time i had this was over 10 years ago, as a sample. So, i describe it as bold, yet fleeting..fresh but ambery and kind of green, the basil i assume. I give it a 7.5 - 7.8 out of 10 but that's because it is something precious to me. The smell makes me feel happy, confident, fresh, somewhat traditional but feels modern to me. Daytime use is better i think but this is rather versatile. Just be careful in extreme heat. Decent projection i guess, but it seems to hide very quick when you smell it a couple times up close. Thank you fragrancenet! Very pleased with all my orders for over 10 years now! Thank you sincerely",5
820,My wife got this cologne for me some time ago for a gift. I decided to buy it again and it smells as good as I remember it. ,5

Mostly she enjoys the compliments she often receives! I, too, enjoy the sensual scents of this fragrance and the fact that it really does last all day and evening! Compliments is something I am most aware of when I wear it too! Thank You #FragranceNet for the great price too!",5
821,"I have been using Burberry Body for several years now. Yes I have tried others but always come back to this one. Its fresh, not to flowery, not strong. Its light and roamntic. I've rec'd so many compliments from people. The body milk is thinner than a lotion. Your skin holds the scent for several hours. High recommend.. ",5
822,I love this scent! I have worn this for several years and have had so many compliments! ,5

823,"In the 70's my husband's company held their annual meeting in Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta. A side trip for the wives was to an upscale mall. Samples of ""FIRST"" were being given out. Nearly every time I wear it, someone comments positively on it. Must have been just the perfect perfume for me and have been wearing it since - nearly 50 years! ",5
823,"Several years ago when I was living in Bermuda I started wearing First. I was amazed how many people asked me what scent I was wearing . Now that I have returned to Canada I am getting the same reaction from ladies here. This soft and gentle scent has become my one and only fragrance I wear. Unfortunately First is very difficult to find in Canada. Thus, I shall be ordering it from your on-line offers. LOVE MY FIRST!",5
823,"Thank you for supplying Van Cleef & Arpels First plus at a great price - it has been difficult to find in stores. I have been wearing First for decades and there is no other perfume that can compare - love, love , love! ",5
823,"First edt by Van Cleef and Arpels: Was just a 'meh' fragrance, and almost unpleasant. Too strong and not distinctive. I like strong, somewhat sweet and spicey fragrances in the winter, but this was just strong.",1
823,I was introduced to FIRST as a graduation gift in high school and have been wearing it ever since. The stores in Dallas stopped carrying it. I found it on fragrance net and am so thankful cause it's the one.,5
824,"Inventor heaven smells great, very refreshing and energizing. Unfortunately, I could only smell it when I first applied it. It was nearly undetectable in an hour. I'd need to carry it in my bag and respray throughout the day. ",3
824,This fragrance is truly HEAVEN. It smells so fresh and is very lasting. I recommend this to anyone. It is hard to discribe. It can be worn by anyone. It is the best smelling fragrance I have ever smelled. It is a little bit of everything. I will always buy this fragrance.,5
825,I get so many compliments on KENZO Amour every time I wear it. I love the smell as it isn’t over powering or to strong. It’s so hard to find in stores so once I found it. I had to buy it. ,5
825,"I have been wearing Kenzo Amour eau de parfum, for almost 10 years now. It is my go to and I never tire of it - still love it and I continue to get compliments all the time - men stop me to ask what perfume I am wearing - you smell so good! I have also converted family and friends are they are now buying it as well. Highly recommend this to anyone! ",5
825,"I have been wearing Kenzo Amour for years. I get stopped everywhere I go by men and women and I always get the same response, Omg you smell so good what is the name of your perfume. They always say it’s the best perfume they have ever smelled. I absolutely love it, oh and FYI it’s great if you have allergies or headaches from perfumes as I do, well this one doesn’t bother them at all. Great perfume. I only wear this and order it every two weeks. ",5
825,"Kenzo Amour is a powdery longlasting vanilla bomb perfectly made. It‘s very feminin. Love it, so does my husband. ",5
825,"About three years ago, I purchased KENZO AMOUR Eau de parfum. A few days later, a stranger approached me and said: ""Excuse me, lady. I don't mean any harm but I've been following your fragrance throughout this store and I just wanna tell you that you are smelling really, really good"". I'm still smiling and still smelling ""really, really good""! I've highly recommended it to family and (ahem!) strangers alike. Thank you so much! ",5

826,"What a unique scent! I got a sample, but am still not sure it jives with my chemistry enough to commit to a full bottle...it’s interesting. I can smell the patchouli, smoked tea mostly, with a hint of rose..and..it’s hard to explain the other fresh note in there. Reminds me of in my hometown in Michigan where there are cherry orchards everywhere. The dry down scent smells like freshly rained on orchard. It’s very unique and interesting. Great combination. I had never heard of this perfume before.",4
826,"It's soft, pretty with a unique scent. Get a sample. It doesn't last so you have to over spray and carry it with you.",3
827,I love the Michael Kors Rose Radiant Gold sent! I get a lot of compliments on it!,5
827,Rose Radiate is ok. Red Ruby is better. I thought it would be more like that fragrance. It's not. But i still would recommend it.,4

829,Been using Aramis Devin Country Cologne since 1972 and I'll never change. Everyone that's around me loves it. Also it stays with you all day with just a little on.,5
829,"They have changed the formula in some way-it isn't nearly as strong and lasting as it was when it was first made. Three stars, sadly, because it only satisfies as a memory, not the real thing it used to be. ",3
829,"I'm glad to see that Devin is once again available. I used it a lot as a young man and it was always my favorite. Thanks for getting it back on the market and at such an attractive price. As far as my nose can tell, the fragrance is the same as I remember. ",5
829,"Very very Good , thank you Aramis Devin",5
829,"I was excited to receive my product, (Devin by Aramis) on the exact estimated date of delivery. I don’t want to be too critical but I have to admit that the fragrance does not smell exactly as the original❗️ ",3
830,"Great smell, projects good for 30 min, has close silage at 1 hour, fades about 70% around a hour in a half and is completely gone just under 2 hours. Great fragrance to own but only use for quick occasions, will not last. ",3
830,John Varvatos Artisan Acqua is a fresh but different citrus smell. It smells like citrus with a spray of sea salt. Fresh.,4
830,John Varvatos artisan acqua is by far one of my favorite colognes. I have tried pretty close to all the “name brand popular ones” and this is my favorite. My wife is not a huge fan of colognes and she will not stop complementing me when I wear this. This is a great buy ,5
830,"Great! I smelled this Artisan Acqua in the John Varvatos store and quickly ordered it from here. Great for the summer/warmer months because it has a crisp smell. It actually stays on heavy although the smell is light, so it’ll last for most of the day. Smells even better once it drys down. ",5
830,"Deeelishous! My Husband received a sample of John Varvatos Aqua with a past order. Which by the way I returned with no hassle or problem. Although my husband has your basic staple colognes. Polo, Kouros, Hugo and Pasha to mention a few. John Varvatos Aqua stands second to none of those. Such a light and sexy sent. Not at all like the others. Very clean and fresh scent. Ladies Father’s Day is just around the corner. Put this one on your hit list. ",5
831,"Locoste Challenge is marvelous. Besides Euphoria and Hei, it’s a go to in the collection. Very addictive smell and is in my top 3. ",5
831,This cologne is amazing!!! ,5
831,This cologne is amazing!!! I was reading a magazine at my barbers shop and turned to the page that had a sample scent on it. I was hooked immediately! The challenge that comes with this cologne is keeping the ladies off you! ,5
832,Great for office wear. I love it.,5
832,"Calvin Klein Reveal smells sexy, it's not cloying and last a fair amount of time. The only thing I don't like is the heavy bulky bottle. Hard for smaller hands to handle. Now back to this lovely perfume, it smells slightly peppery which I love, not sweet at all, the right amount of pepper. ",4
832,Calvin Klein - Reveal. Came in a sealed box. It is the same perfume I buy in the store for a lot more when I can find it. Going to be disappointed when I can't buy it anymore.,5

837,Lovely by Sara Jessica Parker is the best body lotion. I use it all the time. Im surprised that some reviews say that it is a very light smell and you need to use the spray too! I use the lotion by itself and I am always the best smelling lady in the room. Love love love it...,5
837,I purchased the body lotion Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker based on reviews on this site. I was not disappointed. It is a thickish lotion that blends in quickly and isn’t sticky on the skin but the fragrance is very very light so double up and buy the perfume if you want to smell fabulous wafting by people.

839,"I was looking for something new to try and not buy my same perfumes, but after reading the review on this one I decided to try it. I like soft smelling perfumes none over powering. I must admit i was anxious to try this one and Marilyn Miglin now has a new customer. When i got it i had to open it up to smell it i was a little hesitate because i could smell only a portion from the box and it smelled like it was going to be a loud and a strong fragrance but when i opened the bottle on my God it was awesome. All day at work i kept getting compliments and after work I went to my daughter house and i asked her if she could smell my new perfume and she said no. But when i went into the other part of her house and returned to her dining room she said oh my God mom when you was in here i couldn't smell it but when you left the room i could smell your perfume and it smells so good. This pefume smells so good and soft, and sexy, and romantic, i think i turned myself on. Thanks everyone for your reviews without them i wouldnt have bought this perfume. GREAT BUY!! ",5

For me it has a soft,clean romantic feel to it even though it's a casual scent and for those who don't like heavy perfume I would definitely recommend this one over the original unless you prefer that one,but that's cool,to each her own. ",5
842,"I absolutely love Ellen Tracy! I have been using it for several years now. I loved the opportunity to try the shower gel and body lotion along with my regular perfume in this three piece set. I love that Ellen Tracy is subtle, it has a clean smell, and is not too strong. ",5

845,"This fragrance is unbelievable,I have never smelt anything like it before. A friend bought it from Quebec & I have to say,she is one serious shopper who loves expensive stuff.

854,Creed royal water smells great,3
854,I was fortunate to get this on sale and bought three bottles of Creed Royal Water. I have been blessed to have fragrances from all over the world and this is a brisk splash of cold water in the morning. It is not an understated fragrance with its citrus tones of mandarin orange and undertones of musky zest. ONE SPRITZ on your wrist will allow you to move this fragrance to all of your other pulsating areas. It will last all day long and activate well and mellows as the day goes on. Do not be put off by the price as one spray for the day will do the trick. ,5

It is not overwhelming when first applied and the essence stays with one for at least 8 hours (or more!). It is recommended for evening, but I wear it all day just because I can. I love smelling my wrist at the end of the day and still getting the magic of Creed Royal Water.",5

The opening does not smell like alcohol. Definitely does not smell cheap. Skin scent was easily 8+ hours. The bottle i received looks nice. The sprayer is smooth and sprays generously. This was a blind buy for me and there is nothing to regret about it, besides maybe not getting it sooner.",5

877,"Wow, I watched or read all the reviews for Encre Noir. That made me decide to buy Encre Noir L'Extreme and I loved it. So I wanted that smell in something for summer. I have no regrets about Encre Noir Sport. This is easily my favorite summer scent. I like it better than Creed Aventus or Versace Pour Homme. It smells manly. The performance is about right for summer too. On top of that, the price is a steal. Most summer scents are either citrus based and don't last 5 minutes or floral based and smell like a woman's perfume. This doesn't have either of those problems. Performance is good and it has a woody, manly smell.",5
877,Encre Noire Sport Lalique Is what I am wearing right now. A very masculine fresh scent that has good silage and lasts all day. Absolutely my favorite freshie. ,5
877,Buena calidad de esta marca solo que lo recomiendo para adultos.,5
877,"I have all three versions of Encre Noir, and I really thought Encre Noir Sport would be my least favorite, as I don't care for sporty or fresh/aquatic scents. This is actually my favorite of the three, followed by EN original and then EN L'Extreme. Sport version, to me is smoky-woodsy, and very comforting (not as smoky as say, Fumidus by profumum roma). I read somewhere that ""sport"" in perfumery can mean ""to be worn while active, not necessarily for high activity of sports"". This is true of this scent, I personally found that moderate activity (gardening in my case) increases the strength and sillage, as opposed to just sitting around. Longevity could be better, this lasts maybe 6 hours, but being rather linear, reapplying doesn't affect it adversely. Plus the cost is very low for such a wonderful scent. I apply very liberally when I intend to be in the yard most of the day, really enjoyable. ",5
878,"This stuff is simply THE BEST! My husband loves it too and it's the only one I purchase for him. When he wears it, many ask what he's wearing. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!!!",5
878,"I wear Kenneth Cole Signature to work, outings, sleep ect.. My Favorite cologne Ps. Its a Women catcher❤",5

879,L'Amour Lalique is a lovely scent. Very feminine. I have other fragrances by Lalique and this one is right up there with the top scents from Lalique. It's soft and sensual. Wait for the dry down because that is the true beauty of this scent. ,5
879,doux arôme agréable merci ,5
879,"L'Amour Lalique is a very elegant and fresh scent, I'm totally addicted to it",5

882,Awsome and this the only place that I find that it is afordable!,5
882,I absolutely LOVE Red Door Revealed. I have been wearing it for years and am unable to find a scent that goes so perfectly with my natural scent other than this. I am always getting compliments on how good I smell and asked what perfume am I wearing. My only wish is that I could get it in a smaller purse size. I have tried to put it in those vaporizers but it seems to go bad. I LOVE RED DOOR REVEALED!!,5
882,I have used Red Door Revealed for years....I have tried to switch perfumes but I cannot find one that compliments my natural scent like this one. I always get complimented when I wear it which is everyday! I wish I could get it in different sizes but if I can't I will always buy it in what ever size I can find. I LOVE RED DOOR REVEALED SO MUCH!,5
883,Very satisfied with my purchase and love the prices on this website. Everything was delivered on time and smell really good. ,5
883,I love secret obsession the smell is fantastic and it stays with you all day I would recommend it to anyone all year round fragrance,5
883,I thought I would like it but for some reason all I could smell was freshly sharpened pencils.,1
883,"I love this perfume, it is great! Have it as a change off from my favorite so I keep people guessing.",5
883,"Secret Obsession is a very beautiful scent. I goes with anything you may wear, or any occasion.",5
884,Serge Lutens Chergui EDP. Another gamble pays off. I read a lot of positive reviews and comments and decided to take a chance and am I glad I did. One of my new favorite colognes.,5
884,"i had heard about this fragrance on the blogs and yes it is all the raves , i’ll probab give it a four out of five a very pleasant smelling fragrance that has you reaching for the bottle or smelling your hands over and over , you should try it first as colognes are an individual thing happy ",4
884,"I purchased the Parfum version in Paris and I bought the EDT version, here for daytime wear. Every time I wear it I think about Paris. The honey, hay and tobacco stand out for me. I've worn this throughout my 30s. Comforting, mysterious and sophisticatedly warm.",5
884,Beautiful sweet tobacco unisex fragrance. Love it!,5
884,This is a nice warm perfume i smell vanilla and baby powder is sweet and masculine i dont think it projects far i think this smells very similar to dior privee feve deliciouse but not as strong i prefer the dior over this one tho is a good perfume for the price .,4
885,Valentino uomo intense love it really nice fragrance,5
885,"Summer fragrance wearing it f/ the 1st time, wife & female friends like it. The cooler evenings this fragrance performs better. The parfum is the best way to go. ",3
885,I would say it's ok. I just got this so maybe it'll grow on me with more uses but I wouldn't say its spectacular. I was more disappointed than happy with it.,3
885,Very bad!! The fragrance smelled to me like it used to be good and then spoiled. Also the spray is more like a squirt than a spray if you know what I mean,1
885,I absolutely love this fragrance. I recieved many compliments.. Thanks fragrancenet,5
886,I received my order about 2 weeks after I ordered it and I'm loving it and I will be ordering from you all again. Vince Camuto Capri smells so good and I'm glad I was able to get it from you all because I've looked everywhere around town and no one had it.,5
886,One of my favorites!!,5
886,"I just got it, and I like it a lot, it's fresh and not too stronge! ",5
886,Vince Camuto Capri is a fresh romantic scent that is soft and not overpowering. My new go to fragrance,1
886,"This one is a new one for me, and I am glad I took the chance and bought it!",5
887,Vintage Black gift set is great. The deodorant is long lasting and the smell of it is strong going on but not over powering throughout the day. The Aftershave and edt spray are light and not strong yet it carries a distinctive odor that sets it apart from the norm. It is hard to say how long it last as after it goes on you cannot really find the smell but it's there. I recommend this to someone who doesn't want to stand out in the crowd but during those intimate moments wants a sexy smell. It will not be one I'll buy again. ,3
888,"I love this scent!! It's nice and refreshing great for all occasions. Kind of reminds me of a cross between Armani code, and D&G the one. ",5
889,"My new signature! I used to use Eternity, but wanted something different. I get compliments galore! Love this one! ",5
889,"The first time I smelled Esprit D’ Oscar I was flummoxed by how BEAUTIFUL it was. It smells similar to Guerlain’s iconic “ L’ Heure Bleue “ and is actually an improvement of the 2019 version of LB. I find Esprit D’ Oscar to be one of the most feminine perfumes I have ever encountered LITERALLY . It has a retro vibe and is slightly powdery, light, and smell like something I could imagine Carole Lombard wearing in the back of a Bentley with Clark Gable . I own a lot of perfume, but this is a stand out , and something I simply find to be dreamy. I love it so much I have hoarded bottles so I willhve it a long time.",5
889,Oscar De LA Renta I enjoy this perfume. ,5
889,"Spirit D Oscar is my go to fragrance. This bottle does not seem as strong and long lasting as I usually feel. I am not sure if it is just that I am so used to it and I am unable to smell it on myself. Yesterday after 4 squirts, I asked some friends about an hour later and they had to get right up on me to smell it. I prefer it to be a bit stronger. Not sure if it was just me and I did not put enough. Usually 2 squirts is good. Not sure. I do love the scent and it is still my favorite. ",4
889,I love this fragrance. Also love so delarenta. ,5
890,"Hugo Wlement is invigorating, fresh, and sporty. Great for summer. Wouldn’t say it tops my favorites, but if the others weren’t so good, this would be one of them. Very lively smell others notice.",5
890,I bought Hugo element sample & it was half used. Brand new but half gone. False advertising. You pay for full & receive half. Save your money,1
890,"I got small tester first, OMG this is unbelievable scent, I just fall in love with it.. this will be one of my top 5 fragrances for sure..immediately take attention from women ;)",5
890,"Hugo - Element is my new favorite. long-lasting, subtle & clean ",5
890,"WOW! I must say I was blown away when I put this on. I had ordered a small sample years ago, but forgot how beautiful it smells! I felt beautiful and sexy for the whole night when I wore it last week! I knew I was turning heads. 5 STARS! This is by no means a lackluster fragrance.",5
891,"Incanto Charms bought for my daughter, she loves it. ",5
891,"I got this from scent bird as a monthly perfume subscription and I loved it so much I bought a bottle. It smells so good! It's sweet, floral, fruity without giving me a headache. It's one of my favorites. ",5
891,Delightful and Scrumptious scent! Refreshing!,5
892,"Live Colorfully, Smells wonderful; recieved a sample and I went WILD!! Just have to have it! My go to fragrance from now on. ",5

895,"I have a lot of different fragrances. Some are expensive and some are your regular Walmart/CVS purchases. But none, and I do mean, ""NONE"" of them have brought me so many nice compliments as Mediterranean Blue. Every time I wear it, someone is telling me how much they love it. So Do I!",5
895,"I love Elizabeth Arden Mediterranean perfume,so many compliments from my friends.",5
895,"Mediterranean by Elizabeth Arden is a nice scent. For me it was a blind buy. My sister told me it smells good and I quickly ordered a bottle for myself here on FragranceNet. I was pleased on how it smelled. It is such a nice scent, like citrusy and floral but clean at the same time. I just ordered another bottle for my sister which is arriving on Saturday.",5

896,Estée Lauder sensuous nude smells AMAZING and you really get a bang for your buck ! Came in good condition! ,5
896,"I really, really like Sensuous Nude. In my opinion, it is one of the best summer fragrances out there. Slightly coconutty, slightly reminiscent of a day at the beach. Normally, I do not like amber based fragrances, but I love this. Perfect for literally everywhere, from a day at home to the office and beyond. ",5
896,"One of my favorites scents. I love this perfume, warm and lovely. Great price too!",5

And then once, going thru a drive thru to get my coffee the barista said, “please don’t let this offend you, but you smell like money”. Haha. The best of all, my current boyfriend of almost 9 years holds me and says, oh, you smell like a garden. I love it! I use this fragrance 80% of the time, unless I’m doing very casual things, then I wear Eau de Issey by Issey Miaki, because it’s less expensive. I love the fresh clean fragrances. Oh ",5

904,"Ok...!!!for some reason Jaipur is not the same perfum I purchas in the market, usually when I wear this perfum it stays for about 4 to 6 hours depending on how much I wear. This order I wear about 6 sprays shots and after one hour it vanaches in the air, I am very disappointed and I can’t trust there other products.",1
904,"Based on the reviews, I decided to try Jaipur Bracelet. I have never really used the Boucheron products but I really like it.

It is a clean, crisp, masculine scent, but not too strong. It can take you from daytime activity to an evening out. Take a couple more sprays between the office, and that special evening with ""You know who."" This could be a young man's first scent, and it's fine for mature men.",5

I don't know why one reviewer gave only 4 stars when they said they liked it.",5
911,"Estee Lauder's ""Cinnabar"" is a strong and wonderous fragrance. Not for everyone. But you should do yourself a favour and try it. Its a wonderful evening fragrance. ",5
911,"Cinnabar by Estée Lauder was my signature fragrance since the late 60’s, but they changed the formula with the appearance of the new packaging with no warning of having done so. I was extremely disappointed in Estée Lauder for having done this. Others commented at the store’s display of these products of their noticing the change as well. I have as yet to find another fragrance to replace Cinnabar, but I am looking.",1
911,"Cinnabar EDP it has a beautiful essence, aroma that everywhere I go and happens to be wearing Cinnabar, I get so many compliments throughout the years, and also it makes me really sad, because one of my sisters used to love Cinnabar as a gift from me, because she loved it as much as I do, because I lost her from cancer. I still wear it, but bittersweet feeling. Anyway I do recommend it, you won’t be disappointed !",5

911,Got it for the wife and she loves it.,5
912,"This is a very good fragrance. It is a bit sweeter than the original Le Male released in the early 90s. I wore that one back in my 20s and into my 30s. When I tried this one, it seemed much more fit for someone a bit more mature. It would wear well in a formal setting but just as easily accepted in a casual setting as well. I don’t find it quite as spicy as the original, and think it is a good play for me in my 40s. It last long and you won’t need as much as you would normally use. ",5
912,Awesome scent a little on the spicy side last long not much needed ,5
913,So glad I made this purchase. I've worn Jessica McClintock for yrs but never tried JM#3. I read other reviews that convinced me to try and I'm so glad I did. It's a wonderful scent. A huge thank you to all of the positive reviews. Love it!,5

916,"I've just tried Pino Silvestre for the first time because of it's description. I did have a temporary promotional body soap 'cypress fraicheur' that smelled like fresh pine, but can't find it anymore. I had hoped Pino Silvestre would have a Pine scent. It Is a nice woodsie scent, but not any scent of pine. ",4
916,Pino is a solid manly cologne. Goes on strong and slowly weakens over the course of about 8 hours. ,5
916,"Love it, smells like you've been beat over the head with a pine branch, pelted with massive pine cones, and tossed from a moving car down a cliff covered with pine needs. Did I mention I love it!?!?",4
916,I love Pino Silvestre cologne. I just wish that you all made it in a bigger size like the 10 ounce size. Once upon a time the company offered this size. I just love the smell of it. I recommend the cologne to anyone.,5

918,I had tried Oscar de la Renta Live in Love and smells pretty good. I love it and received some compliments. However I tried this perfume So de la Renta and did not like it. Smells strong at first and then vanished. No never again. My favorite is Live in Love. ,3
918,I’ve been using SO by Oscar de la Renta for 20 years already! Never get tired of it! I highly recommended it! ,5
918,"So de la Renta is hands down the best! It is a light fragrance with fresh tones. I have been using it for years and am always told that I smell good. Even though it is eau de toilette, it is long lasting and is still spreading its ambiente after 8 hours of work. My Grandkids say that they love to ride in my car because it has that wonderful Grandma smell! I take that, hopefully, in the right spirit!! ",5
918,LOVE LOVE LOVE this scent! But can NEVER find it! So glad you carry it! Literally ordered 5 bottles!!!!

921,"This new Bill Blass perfume is awesome!! I could not agree more with the past reviewers when they said it should be an evening fragrance. It makes me think of a fancy black tie event with the ladies all dressed up in their lovely ball gowns. The longevity is excellent and come to think of it,it kinda does smell like Charlie.

921,"This BillBlass is very nice, soft and not too sweet. Perfect for Spring and summer.",5
921,"Wow,this is an extremely beautiful fragrance. It has a vintage feel to it,reminiscent of the 70's & I did a comparison. Bill Blass smells a lot like Bora Bora in my opinion. Excellent silage for the price. ",5
921,I have worn Bill Blass for over 20 years & was very disappointed it was no longer available in stores. I was always complimented how good I smelled when given hugs. I did not have to use it sparingly for fear it would be overwhelming. So happy to have it again & I even like the new container design. Size makes it optimal to take on overseas trips.,5
921,Bill Blass long time favorite! Love It!!,5
922,"Claiborne by Liz Claiborne takes me back to my younger years. Years when men weren't afraid to have a scent of ""freshness"" as opposed to the colognes of my father, which were scents that that were overly ""rugged"" and ""musky"". I'll take Claiborne over most of the popular scents that has dominated the men's cologne market.",5

922,I had Claiborn for men many years ago. Loved the light crisp citrusy scent. Not over powering. Light and airy.,5
923,Have worn this wonderful scent for years. I always receive compliments that I smell so good. This is a great perfume choice! One lady said it smelled so good-it reminded her of the flowers on her wedding day and the smell gave her goosebumps and the chills. That is very powerful!,5

923,"I love the Jessica Mcclintlock body powder.. I was using the perfume only until I discovered the body powder and lotion. Now I use all three almost daily. Great scent.

I especially loved using the white body lotion, which I can no longer find, even online. I hope it has not been discontinued. ",5

I get compliments on the scent and many ask what perfume it is that I use! The Nicole Miller (original) scent is perfect for any occasion - dressing up or dressing down -- or just because; I just love the scent and it has long been my 'signature scent' to wear! It has been as much of a morning routine staple as brushing one's hair or cleaning one's teeth - it just is - and it is just perfect! This is something that I will never change. I can no longer find it here in London so I am SO pleased that FragranceNet still sells it - I stock up whenever I can! :) ",5

We were in a beautiful women's clothing boutique when i first got a whiff of this delightful fragrance I asked the woman who was wearing it where I could purchase it. There was a perfumerie right down the street and we purchased it. The rest is history as they say. I have been stopped and asked so many times about this fragrance by complete strangers and receive complements to this day! I have worn other fragrances in the evening that are far more expensive and have never received the complements that I do with my Cabotine We are returning to Italy this summer to celebrate 50 years of marriage and I intend on taking Cabotine with me!",5

They were just launching this perfume and had asked me to try, with one squirt I fell in love with it. I have hundreds of expensive perfumes in my closet but I always go back to Cabotine. People will stop and ask what I wear, some were literally writing it. It last longer than 24 hours and it's so inexpensive.",5
935,"Cabotine de gres’ Has been my “signature” cologne for over 20+ years. Before that I wore Paris, by YSL. That cost over 100.00$ a bottle for 1.5 oz. I was at Marshall’s one day and at that time this chain store sold Cabotine, smelt like Paris. Bought a box. Been wearing ever since. Now I buy w/ you and can’t get over how low the price. Every day I get compliments. Stephanie Harne",5
935,"I love Cabotine, it smells so delicate like a flower, I always am never out of a bottle.",5

I like to use a different perfume each day though I find myself reaching for this bottle more often than not. I reckon it's a go-to for the office and a good desk bottle. When I've scheduled after hour meetings I apply one general spritz on my clothing around 3pm to boost the scent and that's it - good to go mate. ",4
937,"this is the best ever ,every one loves it Emozione bysalvatore ,I only can get it here !",5

955,The soap is just the best smelling stuff I love it,5
955,Japanese Blossom. It's a wonderful product and it scent is marvelous.,5
956,Blvgari paraiba has become my absolute favorite scent to wear! I especially get a lot of men who ask me what fragrance am I wearing. It’s flirty and citrusy yet grown and sexy! And the price on this site Can’t Be Beat!!,5
956,"Upon first spray I was not a fan of this fragrance. I have had a couple other omnia perfumes before & feel they share some kind of warm familiar kinship scent. This one is a little different. I wanted a summer scent. After wearing this through the day, I really really liked it. It changed & now- pretty sure I’m a fan. ",4
956,"bvlgari Omnia paraiba I bought this off this website, as the crystaline I usually wore wasn't in stock. It's really special. And I love the bottle enough to just keep it on my dressing table, but hey...summer's coming and I luv the scent! ..this site has always been good.",5
956,This parfum smells like exotic fruits mixed with pink pepper and beautiful flowers..its tropical without being overly sweet..its very unique and I'm glad I took a chance and purchased it. If you like tropical scents but you want something unique that nobody has then try this I'm sure you will like it.,5
956,I bought Bvlgari Omnia paraiba and it is fabulous. The scent smells fantastic. You can wear it all year long. I get a lot of compliments on it as well. Very good eau de toilette. I will buy more when I run low. Thanks Bvlgari for making this scent. ,5
958,i love the fragranees and gucci flora glorious mandarin is up there with the best,4
958,Gucci Flora Glorious Mandarin tester was just like buying it new best ive ever had and seen looking forward in buying more testers,5
958,I love this scent I get so many compliments when I wear it. It's strong enough to leave your scent in the breeze but not overpowering. I get migraines so it's perfect for me. Fresh and flirty!!!,5
958,Glorious Mandarin by Gucci is a wonderful happy scent which can be worn anywhere if a woman has the right body chemistry. I wish it came in eau de parfume or were a bit longer lasting. I can't smell it after an hour and no one else can either. I still love it. ,5
958,very feminine and pleasant scent. ,5
959,Hanae Mori 'Eau de Toilette' is one of the most sublime and pleasant fragrance's I've ever worn. There are immediate citrus (blood orange and Italian lemon) notes that first hits you. After the high note the middle note discloses evergreen and spice. Finally the dry-down discloses a blonde wood as well as nutmeg and cardamom. The silage is moderate and the life of the essence is moderate as well. All in all the fragrance get's ten-stars for me....the perfect all around fragrance for men (as well as women). This is definitely one of the top five fragrances I go to for any event.,5
959,I've been wearing woman's Hanae Maori for years and decided to purchase it for my husband. He wore it for the first time and received compliments the entire evening. We both love it. Joe & Gail D,5
959,"William, I love this smell been wearing for yrs , but just recently restocked! Recommend! Hanae Maori !",4
959,I've been using the Hanae Mori family of colognes since 2009 and receive compliments any time I wear it. It has become my favorite. I love the scent.,5
959,"Hanae Mori (eau de toilette) is my #1 favorite. Recommended by a saleslady and she was right. Haven't tried the men's ""eau de parfum"" (must mean cologne) yet. I like to wear this at night also, on dates, etc. Lasts several hours. This replaced Pi as my go to, Pi now #2 but also great. ",5
960,"Love it , very soft and amazing fragrance , very good for summer time . ",5
960,I love Prada Candy Florale. It is a soft floral fragrance that can be worn anytime by any woman. A universal scent thats perfect for all age groups. Soft and it lasts all day long. Pricey but worth every penny. ,5
960,"Prada Candy Florale If I had known the scent doesn't last very long would not have bought it. I like the smell, but it only last about 1 to 2 hours.",1
960,Prada Candy Florale is an amazing smelling scent. It makes you want to sniff yourself over and over again!! i just wish it lasts longer!!,4
960,Sweet and soft floral...good for day wear. ,4
961,"Yacht Man Black is pleasant, but it's entirely too light. It's very fresh and clean, but there isn't much to like after the dry down. I can soak myself, and my clothes and my wife still says she can't smell anything. For this reason I will not be revisiting this one.",1
961,Right away the woman loved the smell of it and ask what do you have on yacht man black 2 new numbers in one night. ,5
961,Strong and rich good for causal nights out,5
962,"This fragance is one of my favorites bond no 9 perfums, my first option is Nolita. Astor Place is a really very good scent it last throughout all day. Amazing, nothing compare to this scent. For the person that wrote the review before i would like to say that Nolita is the same scent that I love New York for mothers day that was discontinued. ",5
962,I really loved the fragrance I love New York for Mother's but that's discontinued. I think this is now my favorite Bond No.9 scent.,5
962,"Bond No. 9 Astor Place is a very beautiful scent and the bottle is amazing. I am very happy with the tester bottle. The price is right and I am able to collect all my favorite Bond No. 9 fragrances. Love it , Love it ",5

963,"I AM JUST THRILLED. YOU HAVE CAESAR'S WOMEN, I HAVE NOT BOUGHT ANY OTHER FRAGRANCE, I JUST DO NOT LIKE HOW THEY SMELL. THEY ARE EITHER SO STRONG I GET A HEADACHE OR IT SMELLS LIKE INSECT SPRAY. EVERYTIME I WEAR CAESAR'S WOMEN I GET SO MANY COMPLIMENTS. I CAN NOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR OFFERING CAESAR'S WOMEN",5

964,CK One SUMMER is such a refreshing scent. Thank you ,5
964,The Jury is still out on this one nothing beats CK1 Summer 2011 which is the absolute best.. Summer 2017 has to grown on me as it gave me a headache on this blind buy as in stores it was always sold out so I never got a chance to smell it.. we shall see ,2
965,"I just love ""chill""! Light and great smell. One of my all time favs. Curve chill I believe is one of my favorite curves out there.",4
965,Good business good product,5
965,Curve chill is the best of curve..,4
965,"Claiborne curve chill. Best of the curves. Citrus & musk mixture with a little spice. Is strong when first applied but fades just enough after an hour. Great scent at great price. My everyday cologne. Use others for dates or more formal settings but this would be fine anywhere, anytime. ",5
965,"Great cologne, fast shipping, great variety of cologne",5
966,Amazing! but now with a new design. The picture is not updated! ,5
966,That's my favorite perfume and love will be placing my order for christmas,5

966,Just opened my dolce gabbana light blue lotion& love it.. I also ordered some perfume& i will be shopping again soon! Very happy& prices are awsome,5
966,"My husband and I both wear Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue fragrance. He liked mine so much, I decided to buy him the men's deodorant and spray cologne. This is my go to fragrance. I always feel good when I wear it! Always get compliments when wearing it. I also purchased a atomizer from FragranceNet to carry in my purse & for traveling.",5
968,The best masculine perfume. Very confident among your peers,5
969,My husband has been wearing Jovan Sex Appeal for over 40 years. It still smells as good as it did that long ago. Females still comment today as to how good he smells. Love it.,5
969,"I used to wear KL Homme by Karl Lagerfeld back in the late 1980s, until it was sadly discontinued. If you used to like KL Homme, you will also like Jovan Sex Appeal. They smell very similar and Sex Appeal would make a great replacement. Very nice and slightly sweet, and very masculine. Jovan Sex Appeals smells GREAT!!! A+",5
969,"It smells good, I'll wear it.",3
969,Sex Appeal has always been a favorite of mine! nice fresh scent that lasts the ladies love it!!,5
969,Still a winner since the 70s. Many compliments.,5
970,"This was very unexpected. I thought there would be a syrupy rose in it, but it's still delicious on my skin with oud and praline. Very gourmand without being sickly sweet. It's rich and cozy. The original gold bottle formula with a mosaic rose is different and deeper than the newer version. ",4
970,I love it! Blind bought two bottles about a week ago and am glad I did because this old formulation is now sold out!,5
970,"This scent is incredible and ridiculously addictive. It was a blind buy for me and at first spray, I was skeptical. Skip to two days later, I have to stop myself from drenching myself in it. Absolutely intoxicating. Bought two bottles of this old formula, and I am so glad I did because here I am checking back a week later and it is sold out! 15/10!!",5
970,Oud Bouquet is the best Oud fragrance on the market. The spotlight is really on the Oud but it’s an heavenly gourmand Oud. Amazing!!! ,5
970,Little goes a long way with Lancome Oud Bouquet. Very sophisticated and beautiful,5
971,"Miss Dior Absolutely Blooming. One of the finest I’ve found in years!! Surely a true “nose” created it. It’s clean, classy, sophisticated, unique and absolutely perfect!!! VERY Classy!!! One of those fragrances you will never tire of. Thank you to the nose! I’ve hunted for something truly great for years.",5
971,"I love the Miss Dior Absolutely Blooming, the fragrance smells so nice and captivating. Will purchase again. ",5
971,Miss Dior Absolutely blooming is now my #1 favorite! It lasts all day and I get compliments on it everywhere I go! I purchase the mini vile just test it out and fell in love with it! I will be purchasing a full size bottle for myself and as a gift for a friend as well! Love it!,5
971,"I love it, I have been receiving a lot of compliments wearing it days/evening or night ",5
971,I smelled a sample of this fragrance and loved it. I purchased it because it has a richness and fullness about it. You can smell the layers of notes that come together for a sweet and spicy collaboration. It's more of a winter fragrance for me but I am looking forward to wearing it. It's nice!,4
972,I just received my perfume today Roberto Cavalli Signature eau de parfum in the 2.5 fl oz and it's amazing. This was a blind buy from a YouTuber and I'm glad I did. The only thing to say this is a very sexy warm scent but smells really good and sophisticated!!! I've purchased a previous perfume from this house the original and absolutely loved it so glad that I made this purchase!!!,5
972,"Very, very warm scent. Oriental. If you like an oriental fragrance with strong pink peppercorn note, Roberto Cavalli Signature will be right up your alley.",5

973,I love it. The smells is a perfect blend of sweet scent. Stays on all day long.,5
973,Love this fragrance!!! and love buying my perfumes here <3 ,5
973,I loved this I wish I had gotten the bigger size it's a very feminine light floral with sweet undertones and with a touch of citrus but just enough that it blends into the background of the floral and sandalwood it smells like a hot chick ,5
974,"Bought the clean fresh laundry and love it! Fast delivery, good packaging! Smells so fresh and light... love it, thanks!",5
974,"Fresh Laundry...Fabulous! I have people stop me every day, everywhere I go telling me how great I smell.",5

974,"I have been told sooo many times ""You always smell so fresh and clean"" This perfume is the best smelling perfume you will buy....""if you love that fresh clean scent"" My other favorite is warm cotton. I mix the two in the summer and the combination is DYNAMITE! This perfume will not overpower you but it will linger all day. If you like heavy scents or musks, THIS PERFUME IS NOT FOR YOU! But if you like light fresh and clean scents....THIS IS THE ONE!!!!!!",5

975,"Joy by Dior is a beautiful light flowery summer fragrance, the smell makes me happy and joyful, I feel special when I were it. ",5

975,"I love the new Dior joy perfume,it smells very light not very strong smell,I would recommend this perfume...",5
975,"I bought Joy as soon as it was released (I am a total Dior fan-girl). At first I was a bit disappointed, only because it isn't anything ""ground breaking"". I put it away for the winter and just pulled it out to get me warmed up for spring. In my refreshed frame of mind, I can say this is so pretty. I smells like a girl/woman. It does smell slightly familiar to me;but in all fairness, I have a lot of fragrances in the floral woody musk category. Honestly, when I go through my collection it doesn't smell similar to anything that I have. The longevity is amazing. My work day is 12 hours. With 2-3 sprays it lasts from the time I get ready for work at about 5:30 a.m. until I get ready for bed at about 9-10 p.m. (and faintly when I wake up in the a.m.) Overall I give this 5 stars,regardless of the lack of originality. It's a pretty,pleasant, long lasting easy dumb reach.",5
976,I always buy the Green Tree body cream for my daughter at Christmas. It is a wonderful product. Thank you for supplying this product,5
976,"Elizabeth Arden Green Tea fragrances and lotions are the best. They truly last all day. No matter where I go, people always ask ""what fragrance are you wearing?"" Their second question is ""where can I buy it?"" It truly is a fantastic purchase.",5
976,"We, my 2 daughters and I, love this product. The GREEN TREE ITEMS I PURCHASE EVERY YEAR FOR THEM AT CHRISTMAS. THEY LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THESE. GOD BLESS THIS COMPANY FOR ALL THEIR EFFORTS. ",5
976,This product is the best . I love the smell too.,5
976,"Fantastic value. I normally order the lotion, but I tried this a few months ago and decided I may never go back to the lotion. The Green Tea body cream is a little heavier than the lotion. but works the same. I love it!",5
977,"This smells Great. This can easily be Mistaken with ""1 Million"" by Paco Rabanne which I also own and is much Cheaper. I really like this Fragrance. I'll be back to Fragrancenet to get this Again.",5
977,"I love this sent it's so good, it smells just like one million but it's different, great sent.",5
977,Very good fragancia and cheep price,5
977,"As a cologne connoisseur, Halloween Man edt is one of my favorite fragrances. For the price this cologne can not be overlooked. I don't wear it as an everyday fragrance but when I do, I'm always getting complicated on how good I smell by the women and asked what fragrance is it by the guys. Good stuff!!!",5
977,My favorite fragrance for all times. The best for all events and ocations.,5
978,worn since seventies also seems like scent has changed still great. ,5
978,Monsieur Musk is the best cologne my husband has ever worn. We have probably purchased it for at least 10 years. And..........all the women love it and want to know the name of the cologne so they can get it for their husband. It's the best!,5
978,My husband has worn this scent since the 70's. Monsieur Musk cologne smells so good. He gets compliments all the time and it's long lasting.,5
978,"I received a bottle of Monsieur Houbigant back in the late '70's for Christmas gift, and I thought it was simply the best smelling cologne/after shave I had ever smelled. Very first time I wore some to work, I had coworkers coming up to me ALL DAY LONG asking what it was I was wearing and how GREAT it smelled. Now 40 years later I am still wearing Monsieur Musk and STILL have people telling me how good I smell and all. It has a scent that stays with you, but yet is never overwhelming. This product is simply GREAT as is, and needs no change of ingredients nor improvements.",5
978,"Very satisfied, product as advertised, extremely fast shipping even during holidays.",5
979,My husband love it that's his signature fragrance One Man Show.,5
979,Thanks ,5
979,"I have used One Man Show, exclusively, for more 30 years. It always adds something special for me; if I am in jeans; black-tie or anything in between. The fragrance is crisp, but not over powering. It is gentle on my skin, but long lasting in duration. It is for the Man of All Seasons. This is a Five Star Product. Dr. J. R. Richardson",5
979,"I know this fragrance for a long time and it is the best fragrance you can purchase with this price. It is not cheap at all and it base , mid and final notes go in harmony and I recommend it to any one",5

980,Please restock the larger size of Bvlgari Jasmin Noir,5
980,I’ve been wearing this fragrance for about 5 years and I get compliments everywhere I go. I’ve even had coworkers say that they smelled it in the hall & knew I was around. I pray it never gets discontinued. Please bring the EDP testers back!! ,5
980,"I liked the bvalgari jasmin noir, would like to purchase larger size. Please restock, thanks",5
980,"Please restock on the large size of bvalgari jasmin noir 3.4 oz. It's one of my favorite, I have been waiting for months. Hope you get it soon. Thank you.",5
981,My purchase of Jasmine Noir was my favorite. You can’t find in stores now. The scent smells like rich and sexy. A must have,5
981, I was in a store and a man asked me what perfume I was wearing... he wanted it for his wife... and best of all my guy likes it. I love it since it’s not overwhelming and is just lovely. It is definitely a new favorite!,5
981,"This is a very clean, not sweet parfum. I love it. It does smell to me like someone sophisticated would wear it. My husband likes it. It's not like musky or something you smell on elderly women(my opinion). I am picky about my smells. Some sweet or really musky smells give me ac headache after a while, this 1 does not. ",5
981,"Bvlgari Jasmin Noir is a strong sophisticated scent. One or two spritzes is enough. It is also long lasting. Great evening scent. I wear it during the day as well...It is complex and captivating. If you don't like strong scents this isn't for you, if you do I highly recommend it.",5
981,"I have been using Bvlgari Mon Jasmin Noir for several years now, and I hope this scent is never ever discontinued. It has a light enough aroma that is not overwhelming. Have to reapply a time or two during the day, according to the length of my 'day' but that is not unusual for a lot of light scents. It really does have a beautiful aroma & is not overpowering. Also, I have had excellent service from FrangranceNet. Another company I had dealt with sent me the atomizer spray bottles, when I had ordered the regular spray type - the atomizer spray stopped working in a short time. ",5
982,Creed santal lasts long and smells great and is legit I have a 2016 batch and its smells great ,5
982,"Santal. A nice clean scent. Just don't over apply as it does get overwhelming. However, when used sparingly, it is a nice, fresh scent. My only complaint is that it does not have a lasting presence as does other Creed products that I have used (i.e. Aventus and Green Irish Tweed).Overall, it is pleasant, but common.",4
982,Great Scent. I would buy it again.,5
982,Was relatively disappointed when purchasing. A strong smelling cologne that’s just too “fresh” to where it bothers you. There wasn’t any real “wow factor” that I was hoping for / expecting as I did from Aventus. ,3
982,"I have been searching for this scent for a very long time! One knows when one is introduced to Creed! This is , bar none, a very special scent. A blind buy will do well with original santal! I doubt very much one would return this’s nectar of the gods!",5
983,"I have to say that it is a more mature, adult type of cotton candy scent. Sweet, but not too sweet. And the bottle is gorgeous! Wow! Even when I use this perfume up later, I'm sure that I will keep the bottle to display, it is that magnificent and detailed! Very sturdy, and arrived safely. ",5
983,When I wear cotton candy people know when Iam around (they love it ) I love the smell I will order more than one bottle ,5
983,This is the most amazing smell ever. I have had more compliments on it than anything I have ever worn. Most people I tell go right out and order it!! Amazing/ sweet / loved by all men and women. Highly recommend!!!!,5
983,"I like the Cotton Candy fragrance because it smells sweet, fresh and clean. ",4
983,This perfume smells AMAZING! I wear it to work and get complimented around the office. My Name is Candy And people say this perfume smells like Candy Lol! Its Not too Powerful when the smell hits you. Its just right. I love it! ,5
984,Love both my Clive Christian & Dunhill. Thanks again for the percentages off two of my favorite scents. ,5
984,Wife loves it lasts a long time great cologne! ,5
984,Very happy with it. Fresh sweet can wait for warmer weather to rock this.,5
985,They say this Delish Smell was introduced in 2011! I discovered this smell in 2006 while discovering myself in Florida! So every time I put this on it brings back memories of Lush Sunsets & Awesome Party Nights! Does this come in a Parfum too? Yummy!,5
985,"This is one of my all time FAVORITES. The fragrance stays with you all day. I love when someone says, “mmmmm you smell good what’s that you’re wearing.” Im definitely ordering again.",5
985,"Ever since a friend of mine introduced Escada""s Rockin Rio eau de toilet, I have used it every single day, andI I get a lot of compliments. People will stop and say, what ate you wearing because they want to buy it! Although I have an allergic reaction to so many other fragrances, with either sneezing or a runny nose after spraying on, never with Rockin Rio. With it's romantic scent, for me it's a win win situation every time .",5
985,"Love, love, love. I get so many compliments and my two girls have asked me to start buying it for them as well because they get so many compliments when they borrow some of mine. Worn this for years and will continue to do so! :-)",5
985,I've been on a few dates with a man that loves this scent. Always compliments me when I'm wearing it. Last time as soon as I arrived at his house he told me again how much he loved my perfume. Ordering a couple more bottles now. ,5

987,"This Jay Z gold after shave cream, is another way to use it as a gift, without the regret to fail. It's so good, with a mild essence of vanilla and other combinations, is coming to the market to make a difference! We will buy it again in a near future! ",5
988,I like the soft gentle smell of Jovan Musk. It isn't over baring.,5
988,Hi I have been using Jovan Musk since 1970 I would not buy any thing else not even white musk. What I don't understand is why they changed the body power spray to liquid. Please go back to the can. I smell like I just got out of the shower.,5
988,"My boyfriend (now husband of 45 years) bought this for me when I was 16. I have been using it ever since! I get lots of compliments on the beautiful, mild scent. Hopefully, they will keep making it for years to come!",5

989,"I ordered the gift set just because I saw other reviews. I received it today, and once I opened that box and sprayed it on my arms, I was instantly in love with this fragarence, OMG, it has such an awesome soft smell to it, and I received the lotion and shower gel also, I put the lotion in my purse I also put it on, and it has a shimmering affect to it also. Needles to say, I am going to order two more boxes since I saw there is a clearance of the gift set. Thank you to the people who post their reviews. ",5
989,"Wow; what an amazingly feminine scent!!! Way to go, Kim. Kim Kardashian’s EDP is without a doubt, my new favorite scent. I absolutely LOVE the smell of this fragrance & so do others-both men &women. Recently my BFFs & I were in Las Vegas having a drink when a woman approached us & asked who smelled soooo good. I was so confident she was referring to me and my Kim Kardashian’s EDP, I spoke right up. My BFFs baulked, but it was soon confirmed to be me and all I could do was blush while I went online to show our new friend the product...",5
989,"I love this perfume!!! I spray it on me, my sheets and everything else that I want to smell fresh! When I start getting low I freak out until my new bottle shows up.

I love it!",5

I’m not disputing people’s complaints about the new formula in the changed packaging because the same can be said pretty much all across the board here. Some say old musky, while others say green, depending on the ancillary product. I would describe the edt as violets over a green base among other flowers that oddly reminded me of Guerlain, which I love. A nice Springtime scent.",5
993,"Yardley English Rose EDT--Along with their other wonderful English Rose scented soap and lotion, just heavenly...timelessly, elegantly, wrapped in a true rose fragrance that just lifts spirits, but comforts as well--the wonderful value of Yardley is why Yardley endures. Happy!",5
993,"Yardley Iris is a dead ringer for Hermes Hiris and for a fraction of the price. If you like Hiris, you'll love Yardley Iris.",5
993,"English Bluebell is fresh, sweet but not very long lasting",4
993,"Yardley April Violets - Love it! Smells great. I read a lot of people talking about how this is a new version. I have no idea what the original smelled like, so, judging it only on what I like, this scent is fantastic. Very pleased.",5
994,"I bought Black Pearls on a whim. I have never owned a real perfume before only body sprays and at 28 I got tired of smelling like cotton candy sugar. I do not smell the vanilla, bergamot, or leather in this to me it smells like maybe spiced flowers. (but not bad flowers the nice kind not overwhelming or overly “floral”....keep in mind I know next to nothing about perfume) However I really like it a lot I am prone to migraines and just going into certain perfume/body fragrance stores will give me a massive headache. This smells really good without triggering a headache, it lasts a long time, and as a plus when I put it on my husband asked what smelled so good! He says it smells sexy to him and was VERY pleased by it. I will definitely be buying this again when I run out you cannot beat the price.",5
994,"Black Pearls has always been my favorite! Wearing it just makes me feel beautiful and romantic. I receive so many compliments everytime I wear this lovely, long lasting perfume by Elizabeth Taylor. I'm surprised by how many women have never heard of this wonderful perfume. And men are very attracted to it ... I suppose that was Elizabeth Taylor's actual intent when she created Black Pearls. ",5
994,"Black Pearls by Elizabeth Taylor stays with you all day...it is intoxicating, and yet cozy. Thrilled to have found this fragrance here!!! The best prices are here!!!",5

994,I love black pearl by Liz Taylor can't find it anywhere I was so happy to find it and it was a great price ,5
995,Hugo Boss Intense is a very creamy vanilla with honey. I like it for a night out ballroom dancing or the theatre but not so much for burgers and a movie. YMMV. The scent doesn’t announce you’ve arrived but gets the attention of those in your vicinity. After 6 hours the scent is reserved for someone kissing close. ,5
995,"Awesome scent! Masculine, and a compliment getter! On my skin it last a good 6 hours with 3 sprays. I can see myself buying another bottle for sure! Guys get this. Your lady friend will love it!",5
995,"Smells really good. Very good projection and lasts more than 12 hours (yes, it's a beast when it comes to longevity). This is really good product and 3-4 sprays the morning are enough for the entire day. However, Strong smell makes it not suitable for some workspaces like hospitals and even some offices. Its not everyone's cup of tea. Overall, I'm really happy with the product.",5
995,Hugo boss intense edp smells really good the first time I smelled it I was like wow but remind me immediately to that vintage diesel perfume bug spray looking bottle green g-n masculine. Kind of similar smell not the same but really close. Overall really good scent. I love it.,5

Purchased it without any prior trial sensory perception.... but the description was right on... and guided my purchase... thanks for such an honest impression of the scent.... ,5

Boy am I surprised on a new fragrance I purchased sight unseen... My body chemistry and this scent are perfect... a wonderful addition to my stick to signature scents... Love this going into Fall.... I highly recommend for all those close up compliments you will receive. I will definitely purchase this again.... so glad your prices make trying new fragrances affordable... and memorable!!! ,5

999,"The White Shoulders body wash is so luxurious. It takes me back to a wonderful time of life in my 20s. If this product was also available in a larger size it would be a winner! In the meantime, I'm certainly enjoying my White Shoulders powder, lotion and perfume.",5

1000,"Escada fiesta caricoa is the worst escada scent I ever smelled. I ordered this product knowing that I have had great success with other Escada products, but this scent was way too sweet and was horrible. I am trying to think of an age range that this might be appropriate for and I don’t believe it would be appropriate for anyone!",1

1002,Incanto Shine is a delightful fragrance that I can wear around practically anyone. I get many comments on how good I smell. It stays true on my skin. Many other perfumes change on my skin in an unpleasant way. I love it!,5

1005,I purchased the sample and loved it. I ordered the 8.4 oz and am completely unsatisfied. Scent does not last. Extremely disappointed.,1
1005,"Royal Mayfair is a unique fragrance. Great performance, I get 10 solid hours. The initial spray hits you with a strong scent of Gin, but after aproximateley 20 minutes, it mellows down to a beautiful rose and white flower aroma with a slight boozy Gin lingering in the background. Many compliments from both female and male co-workers. A cashier at victoria secret store, told me how wonderful I smelled. She wanted to know what I was wearing, and wrote it on a piece of paper.

1007,At first I thought Nicki Minaj's Onika smelled similar to Pink Friday but I was way wrong..after the initial spray all I smelled was fruits specifically pears..loved it an it lasts all day..gave it to my sister since she loved the smell also,5
1007,It is absolutely my favorite perfume I have ever worn. Will definitely be the one I keep in stock.,5

1012,I love CLEAN Ultimate. I was about to use the last of what I have. This fragrance replaced the Philosophy Pure Grace I was once purchasing before they changed formula. I use several of the CLEAN fragrance and like them because they are light and I can mix them. The Ultimate is a good fragrance for spring and summer. Light and fresh.,5
1012,"I have almost the entire line. Started with Shower Fresh then Fresh Laundry, Cool Cotton, Cotton T Shirt and Clean Ultimate.

Gift sets available also on this site. Chetit out you will be amazed!!!! Great gift ideas also!!! Hey I was hooked as soon as I first found this site!!!,5
1013,I just received this and was very dissapointed by the lack of fragrance. The formula itself is nice but the fragrance is too light to wear alone. Pairing it with the perfume would be better.,3

1014,I have used Curve products for many years but the Curve Appeal is so far my favorite it has a subtle sweet and clean scent ,5
1015,I miss the Dune lotion and cream - the most beautiful fragrance - only one I can wear - all the others burn my nose,5
1015,"Ok, so I've been on a nostalgia kick lately. I remember my grandma wearing Dune by Christian Dior way back in the early nineties when I was about 11 or 12. So I thought what the heck, I'll order it. It came within 3 days (wonderful!) and I sprayed some on. Let me tell you, I HATED it on first spray, then I gave it a few minutes. WOW. WOW. WOW. The dry down is spectacular. Somehow it's oceanic, floral, and spicy all at the same time. Nose magic. So worth buying!",5
1015,I adore Dune by Christian Dior. I am now 70 and I need to buy it on special. Very hard to get it on special. Hope it comes back in at a good price for the loyal customers who have been supporting Christian Dior for years.,5

It also lasts all day, so don't be frightened away by the price. ",5
1016,Molecule 01. This stuff really is fantastic. Can’t get enough of that smell. Smells very clean and fresh. Wish I would have bought this earlier. I hear some people cannot smell anything. I’m just glad I’m one of the lucky ones who can. ,5

There is a lingering aroma of citrus, vanilla and exotic, sexy undertones that are captivating. I know he will enjoy it as much as I do!",5
1020,When I first sprayed Issey Miyake Nuit I wasn't very fond of the loud opening. But the dry down turned into a nice woodsy powdery masculine scent that I think most men would enjoy,5

My coworkers have told me that they know when I'm at work because they can smell my perfume in the hallway after I've walked thru it. An ex bf told me he could still smell my perfume on his pillow even after a couple days. It is a very long lasting perfume. It is not at all over powering.

1027,Oxygene eau de parfum by Lanvin is a very nice fresh and classy smell. I bought this for my lady about a year and a half ago and she loved it. The projection on it is good I don't recall how long the scent actually last. But if you want to make your lady happy with some quality juice on a affordable budget look no further.,5

1028,"I wore this lovely fragrance Signoria Misteriosa by SF to attend a co-workers 50th Birthday celebration, I'm 33yrs old and everyone I came accross the dance floor gave me compliments on how amazing I smelled the entire night. ",5
1028,Signorina Misteriosa eau de parfum is simply seductive blended with a sweet and flowery. The presentation is really classy and beautiful. The aroma just makes me think of woman in sheer dresses or tight satin dress with lingerie underneath wearing elegant earrings and driving a Porsche. I bought this to keep as a collection. I am a male and do buy female fragrances for myself. I do let my female room-mate have test and they loved it so she will buy herself one too! This fragrance is authentic and lasts pretty long on my skin (about 6 hours) until it disappears. IDK if this differs to a female but its longevity is awesome! ,5
1028,I LOVE THIS SCENT!! one word to describe it: SEXY. I make sure i keep a rollerball of this scent in my purse. Great office scent that can turn into a night time scent. Soft blackberries with a scent of vanilla. You cant go wrong with this one. ,5
1028,"I absolutely love this scent, very sexy, alluring scent. You can't go wrong with it. Signorina is one of my favorite scent's I figured I couldn't go wrong with this one, I purchased the rollerball first to see how I would like it. OMGoodness I was very impressed. I receive lot's of compliments every time I wear it. I just purchased the 3.4 perfect and 3.4 lotion gift set for myself. Can't wait for it to arrive. ",5

1029,This fragrance is spectacular! Constant compliments! Should last longer!,4
1029,"The bottle is beautiful, and much larger than I expected. Howevery, based on the description of the Taylor by Taylor Swift perfume, I was expecting it to be fruity and sweet. Not the case at all. Its more of a musk/sandalwood scent. Not sure if I like it. ",2
1030,"I absolutely love the smell of this , very pleasant and long lasting. ",5
1030,I wish you sold bigger containers of Versace Bright Crystal body lotion and shower gel. But I had to take what you have and be proud to get it !!!

I'm sure there are MANY people out there that love that fragrance and would purchase them from you !!!,5
1031,"Love this on my man - spicy, woodsy yet clean. I wasn’t always a Versace fan until I discovering Dylan Blue. It smells the way a really good looking, polished man should smell!! Thanks FragranceNet for offering this mini travel size set for such a steal of a price! ",5

1032,"This is the best smelling mens cologne I have ever smelled, Why they don't revert back to the old formula with the dark bottle is beyond me.... Everybody who wears this asks the same question, It smells Great but please go back the old formula it smells even better. I'd give this cologne 5 stars if they went back to the old formula.",4
1032,"Aramis 900 Herbal is excellent, have been using it for 20+ years after being introduced to it by a friend in Hong Kong.",5
1032,"simply one of the best, a must have",5
1032,I came upon this fragrance by accident ( Aramis 900) and have not stopped buying it for my partner--he himself loves it and always gets lots of favourable comments--even after washing his clothes you can still smell it. It sure is a winner. I am vey much into fragrances and like him to smell nice and sexy!!,5
1032,"This is my number one of the 4 or 5 Scents I use. Hard to find in stores anymore. All are of the Musk, woodsy type. The exception to that fragrance is Green Bott Polo, although even that has a lingering mystery type scent. ",5
1033,Champs Elysees is my favorite perfume. It has a clean and floral fragrance. I am so glad that I finally found a place to purchase it again. Most places do not carry it because it is an older perfume.,5
1033,"I have been wearing Champs E'lysees since I was a teenager. My mother gave me a bottle on either my 13th or 16th birthday I believe? I have not stopped wearing it since. I love it & most people around me do as well! I have tried to switch to a new scent over the years, but my nose doesn't want another Lol ! Now, the fragrance is very difficult to find, except for this site really. Thank you for having it available !",5
1033,I bought this fragrance and it was so strong I got a headache whenever I wore it. I gave it to my friend and she smell's so good and it doesn't bother her at all. ,5
1033,"Champs Elysèes by Guerlain is a combination of soft, exquisit fine flowers with a perfect touch of sweet. At the same time is a so clean fragrance too... I love various perfumes but, I have three favorite classics and this one, as fine and subtle as it is, has a strong presence...is so...unforgettable. Thats why for me, Its the Jewel of the Crown. A fragrance that I use every time I want to feel feminine, fine and sexy but specially when I want to impress. And never dissapoints me. People loves it and look at me identifying the ""fragrance bearer"", and keep asking for the name of my perfume. ""Champs Elysèes by Guerlain"", I answer. No need of more words.",5
1033,Champs Elysees is absolutely amazing! It is very unique and fresh perfume! I've adored it since I have been a child. Even as an edt it is very long-lasting and unforgettable. Though it has been around for a long time I feel like it could fit women in their 20s and up. Definitely recommend!,5

1036,Nirvana Black is not what I was expecting. Its very manly and extremely strong. Not a fan,2
1036,"Nirvana Black, not my favorite. Its a musky manly smell. I prefer light floral smells. Not what I like. ",2
1036,This is my absolute favorite perfume ever!!! I get so many compliments on it whenever I wear it. I am so upset that they stopped making it.,5
1036,"I absolutely love Nirvana Black. It is one of my all time favorites and I own tons of perfumes. This fragrance I normally layer with the twin of Nirvana White. Together the aroma is amplified harmoniously. I’ve purchased the rollerballs to freshen them both while on the go. Lastly I start my application of the perfume with the Nirvana Black oil as a base. Outstanding product and come to think of it, the blend of Nirvana Black and White is my signature fragrance. Musky, woodsy and feminine at the same time. I wear them year round. Lots of compliments. Highly recommended. ",5
1036,"I recently purchased the Elizabeth and James Nirvana Black. It is the most perfect fall scent. A little touch of masculine with a sweet hint of sex appeal. It is simply stunning, though I find that it does not linger on the skin as other perfumes do. A small con to an otherwise amazing perfume! I am in love with the scent and with the steal of a price, I absolutely do not mind reapplying.",4

1040,Acqua Essenziale I bought this for my son as he finished his first. The packaging is elegant and Fragrancenet 's delivery was fast and well packaged so there was no damage. Can't wait for him to be surprised as I cannot purchase this in my local stores anymore.,5
1040,I luv it i broke my bottle so i had to buy another,5
1040,If this cologne Acqua Essenziale was perhaps 10% stronger and lasted a few hours longer I would think it would be the perfect men's fragrance for spring and summer.I love this stuff wow!,5

1041,I have used Design as my primary fragrance for over forty years. I prefer to use the shower gel and lotion before I put on the perfume. I wear this almost daily. Love it and get so many compliments for it.,5
1041,"I always have ""men"" asking me, ""what's the name of your perfume?"". One of my favorite's and the lotion is a nice touch for a small portion goes and last a L O N G time.",5
1042,I love the fragrance and I can't find it in the stores. You have such good prices. ,5
1042,"I have a bunch of Escada LEs and this is my #2! . (My #1 is Ibiza Hippie-hope they bring it back!!) SG is a beautiful fruity floral which lasts longer than most of the others. Great summer scent, but I wear it year-round. (my first is Ibiza Hippie-hope the bring it back!!)",5
1042,"Escada Sexy Grafitti This fragrance captured me by it’s fruity yet delicately ripe and sweet scent. I can smell sweet candy, sophisticated cherry, (I know odd) mature grapes and there’s just something that I cannot describe but it reminds me of my childhood. Very pleased with this purchase, pleasant scent in a pretty bottle!",5
1042,MY NEW FAVORITE PERFUME ! ,5

1043,"I bought this because I heard my husband talking about how much he liked a (something) Blue.....which I thought was Givenchy Blue. When he saw it he said it wasn't the same bottle. We both smelled it at the same time and simultaneously said WOW!!!! this smells awesome, I said very sexy.....yum. Fresh a tad bit of swetness liners at the end with outdoor wood freshness. A little aquatic (ocean) scent in the beginning.",5
1044,Yessss ladies I love Ms Gucci Guilty she is a groan woman scent great for work if you work in a office I don’t recommend it as a everyday fragrance for me but it is a beautiful scent I do recommend purchasing this one!,5
1044,I’m just obsessed with how good it smells and how long it actually stays on you is amazing too,5
1044,First time purchase of Gucci Guilty...I have been using other fragrances for years. I received a small sample of Gucci Guilty and thought I would give it a try. It is delightful. Beautiful smooth fragrance. I guess I found a new gentle fragrance,5
1044,"Beautiful fragrance! This smells so amazing! It's the perfect balance. The original Guilty was a bit too strong for me, but this one is on point! ",5
1046,I hope you get Guerlain Oud Essential back in stock soon. I wear it everyday. It is an amazing scent and I need to order more. ,5
1046,Oud Essential is my new favorite scent. I have always loved earthy patchouli musty scents. Oud takes earthy scents to a whole new level. I can’t stand being without it!!! Previously my most favorite scent for years was L’herre Blue. I never thought I would find a scent I would like better. Oud Essential has done just that. ,5
1046,"I don't care for this scent, it reminds me strongly of Another Oud by Juliette Has a Gun. Quite linear and the oud note is very strong, like Montale's. It would have been a scrubber, except I wanted to see if it would change, it didn't, just the same strong, not barnyard, not bandaid, not blue cheese, possibly synthetic oud note, for 10+ hours. I'll stick with 33 by Ex Idolo, Oud Palao by Dyptique ( I own full bottles of both). Caron's Secret Oud is on my want list. This the third Guerlain scent I've tried, I haven't liked any of them.",1
1047,I had to have the Victoria’s Sectet Tease Noir perfume just for the bottle!! Fragrance is so feminine and sweetly floral but not too overwhelming . So that’s a bonus for me ! Lot of reviews have said that the atomizer doesn’t always work fine and I have noticed that the spray is not a fine spray but I love that it comes with an atomizer so I don’t mind. The bottle does come with a regular cap and an advisory to use the cap while traveling with the bottle.,5
1047,"This scent is nice and delicious, my husband loves when I wear it. I firs get it because I love the bottle but it is now my favorite!!!",5
1047,"Love it! Love it! Tease, Nior Tease! I first smelled it on a client and had to have it in my collection! I smell very pretty, yet sexy!",5

1048,I love this scent. I love fresh green scents! This one is a great scent if that's what your looking for. I just wish this perfume lasted a bit longer. It seems to wear off too quickly! -Shauna; Massachusetts!,4
1048,"This has been my signature scent for 5 years and I was heartbroken when Dillards said it was discontinued. I found it at a kiosk at the mall and bought them out when they had it on clearance and said, they would also stopped selling it...the scent is suttle and light... it's hard to describe, but the compliments will be non stop!",5
1048,"DKNY Verbena I have worn this and ordered from this company and I have never been disappointed, I have worn this for years",5
1048,Pure DKNY Verbena is my new favorite scent!!! Will definately keep ordering it!!,5

I am loving the Bond No. 9 fragrances and I am also pleased with the great service I continue receive from FragranceNet.,4
1051,"Excellent spring/summer scent for either gender. I get a lot of compliments from Bond no 9 High Line (both men & women), and it has a fresh out of the shower scent. I purchased the tester and will buy again.",5
1051,"Bond No.9 High Line is a clean scent that goes on solid and remains active for many hours. Love the positive comments I receive on it. Purchased the ""tester"" for the second time and only thing different than the ""full"" product is the cap. Will buy again from FrangranceNet as the experience is always great.",5

1056,It is a soft long lasting scent.,4
1056,You should try/sample before you buy this cologne. THIS is not a safe blind buy; its a love or hate fragrance. ,2
1057,"I was expecting to like this more than the EDT but I'm actually fairly disappointed. The opening with the anise and the sichuan is definitely sweeter, but to me it's not very fitting with the rest of the scent. This version also appears to hit the ambroxan note much harder, which I am not into. Just comes off artificial and soapy. That said, it's still wearable and not inherently a bad scent. Just not what I'm into.",5

1065,Acqua DiSelva! Very mild aroma almost..... Product description appropriate.,3
1065,Took a chance on ordering this and I was not impressed. Blah and uninteresting. ,1
1066,"Alyssa Ashley Musk Oil was given to me, MANY years ago, as a gift. This was the only fragrance I ever wore forever. Everybody loves the way I smell even people I don't know approach me and comment how wonderfully fragrant I am. Thanks for that.",5
1066,Alyssa Ashley musk is a very soft romantic scent nice for a daily Fragrance,5
1066,This has been one of my most favorite fragrances for many years. I can only find it at Sears and on your website. You offer a variety of things which I enjoy trying. ,5
1066,Alyssa Ashley Musk oil is the only perfume I find I can wear without the sent bothering me :) My husband will always comment on how nice I smell when wearing it. ,5
1066,I love the light smell of Alyssa Ashley musk oil & the body cream. The body cream I prefer is out now but the the large bottle of cream is also very good. Using the oil plus cream makes is last.,5
1067,This smells absolutely amazing. I knew it was a winner when my wife said she like it. I have purchased several other colognes on this site but Armani Le Parfait is the best!,5
1067,"Armaf la parfait I honestly don't know where these reviewers are smelling, i purchased this cologne based upon the reviews I read thinking it was worth the buy upon opening the box and spring it on myself I came to realize this is just another cheap cologne that you could buy at the dollar store you're getting more alcohol than actually cologne I tried very hard to get a scent out of it but there's nothing there I would not recommend buying this cologne",1
1067,"Armaf Le Parfait is absolutely INCREDIBLE!! It has such a fresh/earthy smell and I love it. I actually liked it so much I ordered another bottle lol. It does have a Creed GIT scent to it for sure, which I love. I believe I actually like Le Parfait better IMO. Which I know everyone's opinion varies but it just smells so good. Also a bonus is the longevity for me, it easily last a good 8 hours. For the price you can't go wrong in any way. I really dig Armaf ",5
1067,"I just bought this after wearing club de nuit intense man for quite awhile and might I say, holy crap. This cologne takes the world of Nuit (a clone of Creed Aventus) and adds the best parts of Creed's green Irish Tweed without any of the harshness. The dry down is clean and seductive and makes you thank the heavens above for your decision, I know I have.",5
1067,"Honestly, I find this scent to be horrible. It was a blind buy and I regret making it. Do I really have to give it one whole star?",1
1068,Omg...... Its the best bond EVER HE LOVED IT,5
1068,Good fragrance very good,5
1068,I Love New York For Fathers Eau de Parfum,3
1068,"This is an amazing aroma for the mature, professional male. It starts off springy and flowery with a strong mix of lavender and coriander flowing boldly but soon soothes down to a fresh clean scent which is good for the next 10 hours tops. I loved it!",4
1068,bond no 9 i love new york for farthers is a great scent perfect for farthers day!!!,4
1069,"I find Diamonds and Sapphires by Elizabeth Taylor to be absolutely intoxicating! I was going through my perfume stash tonight and came across it. I had completely fogotten that I had it. I took a shower & before toweling off I sprayed several sprays on my wet skin, rubbed it all over myself & then towel dried. This leaves you lightly scented all over, then I lifted my hair in the back and sprayed a little in my hair. I have to say I smell heavenly now! I also love White Diamonds very much but Diamonds and Sapphires has a softer more romantic fragrance. I forgot how wonderful it smells. When this bottle is gone I will definitely be ordering more.",5
1069,my favorite from the Diamonds collection. ,5
1069,DIAMONDS & SAPPHIRES I love this perfume & it is very hard to locate. Super happy Fragrance Net did.,5
1069,"Elizabeth Taylor's DIAMONDS & SAPPHIRES is a lovely, feminine scent. Like all her scents, this is a well-blended perfume. Like a symphony, all the notes come together to make a whole, rather than a collection of solo parts. This is the ""lightest"" and most ""white flowers"" of her collection, I think. The lily of the valley notes are most predominant, and therefore, make it great for spring, summer, and day settings. Having said that, if you love it and it suits you, wear it 24/7/365! It can be office friendly when used with a light hand. Silage is moderate and longevity outstanding. Not for the young enamored of sugar and candy, and not for those wishing to make strident statements. But a beautiful, lady-like woman comfortable with her femininity and power and the total package, will appreciate this. ",5
1069,Diamonds & Sapphires is truly a wonderful feminine scent tht lingers on my skin throughout my busy day. Absolutely love this scent.,5
1072,"Hate it, Smells like adidas pulse aftershave. I have sensitive skin and it felt like I rubbed gasoline on my face with sandpaper. Moral of the story; you can't tell from a written description what a product like that is. ",1
1072,I have been using Grey Flannel for over 45 years. Love the smell.,5
1072,I really appreciate and will always continue to use my Grey Flannel by Geoffrey Beene. In my opinion it is the quintessential male fragrance and I hope that it is never discontinued!,5
1072,"Grey Flannel is a spicy, very masculine scent. Smells expensive and refined. A real business man's scent.",4
1072,Grey Flannel aftershave lotion is a great product,5
1073,"they use to have it in the public restrooms at Greyhound Bus stations,I used it in the 60s and early 70s then it disappered this is the first time i saw it since the 70s thats great . I thought it was gone for ever. Thank you so much",5
1073,"I have used Jade East for many years-there was one pharmacy that carried it for several years after it was gone from everywhere else. When they stopped I thought it was gone for good but my wife found it here and we have ordered it ever since. I love the fragrance of it and she does too. I wished that Regency would start producing Hai Karate, that was my favorite back in the 60's. Maybe some day.",5
1073,Jade East Cologne Brings back great High School memories when I smell the Jade East Cologne. ,5
1073,I really like both the after shave and the cologne. I looked for it for years and then about three years ago I saw your ad and Jade East. It reminds me of being back in High School and my first car. Of course now I’m on a fixed income and I have to save for awhile before I can buy more when I run out of one of them. They are lots more money than when I was younger. Thank You for keeping it in stock. ,5
1073,Great fragrance!!!! Brings back many memories. (Good ones that is) a classic that every man should have,5
1074,"I get more compliments every time I wear daisy by Marc Jacobs, I love it!",5
1074,"I love this scent. It's perfect for any occasion; date night, office job, or just stay at home mom. The best thing about it is its scent is unique to whomever wears it! ",5
1074,"Marc Jacobs Daisy has a nice scent, it just doesn't stay on you long",2
1074,I love this scent I think it comes out on everyone differently which I love anyone can wear it,5
1075,"Perfect! Not too strong, not too light. I like the complexity of the fragrance. AND, best of all, at a great price!",5
1075,Don't let this colonge go by without being part of your collection of fine fragrances. It's definitely a good buy.,4
1075,"Such a bold scent, hence the name. I really enjoy this cologne as a everyday cologne. It’s strong but not overpowering. ",5
1075,Tommy colognes are always good to have and at a great price ,5
1075,Love the smell last very long,5
1076,I like Acqua di Parma- Rosa Nobile. It is a perfume I discovered about 2 years ago and I love it. If you like roses this is the scent for you. ,5
1077,"It smells exactly like champagne and strawberries. Very pleasant and long lasting scent. You can wear it casually, or even dressed up in a suit. Women can also wear this. This fragrance is a winner.",5
1077,I bought Black XS for my son many years ago & he loves receiving all the compliments too! I love the scent too.,5
1077,I wear it all the time and always get compliments.,5
1077,"Excellent, I have been using Black XS for years.",5
1077,"Black Xs, Don't think too much, only buy it :))",5
1078,"This has to be my new favorite perfume! I bought it with hopes that I'd like it, and turns out i LOVE it. It smells so clean and different. It changes on your skin over time (it works with your chemistry). I just bought it and I want to buy another one. I feel like I don't want to run out and not have it. I'm not gonna lie, I'm obsessed.",5
1078,I decided to give CK One Gold a try after smelling it in a store. Its a very light and inviting scent. Sillage isn't bad but the projection seems to die down after a couple hours. Definetly is a unisex fragrance. My GF actually wears it more often then I do.,4
1078,"This is a great fragrance! This scent is both fruity and woodsy. Rare combination. I honestly feel this can be worn by both men and women, very versatile and unique. Does not last as long as I wish it would ",5
1079,"I tested this perfume at ULTA, and as bad as I wanted it, I wasn't comfortable with it being $64.00. I forced myself to wait and my boss actually referred me to this website. I looked up this perfume. and got it at a comfortable price!!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVVEEE this fragrance!! Its sweet, and long lasting. Also try Escada Taj Sunset.",5
1079,AMAZING!!!! LOVE IT!!! I'VE BEEN USING ESCADA CHERRY FOR 5 YEARS NOW AND I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ELSE. STRONGLY ADVISE,5
1080,Brought a bottle of this cologne years ago in the Bahamas never paid attention to who the maker was until I ran out and was searching all the shops in the Bahamas nobody knew what it was till i happen to find it here on fragrancenet. It's not an expensive cologne but i like the scent. ,5
1080,Ordered two Faconnable bottles of cologne. One arrived broken. Called FragranceNet and immediately they replaced the damaged bottle. It was received in a week and was thrilled with their service. I highly recommend them. It was my first time order and will have many more to come. The only place to purchase perfumes. A customer forever. ,5
1080,"good stuff, lasts and smell good.",5
1081,"I have liked Jacomo de Jacomo since it came out in the 1980s. I remember one spray would smell great, stay consistent, last all day and into the next day. Unfortunately, that is not the case anymore, maybe my body chemistry has changed or maybe the formulation has changed. Either way now it still smells nice, but it seems much weaker, and does not last nearly as long (about an hour or so).",4
1081,"I only ordered the mini .25 oz. of Jacomo de Jacomo by Jacomo just to see if this fragrance was the same as the one I remembered a friend wearing from so VERY many years past. I didn't remember the name of this wonderfully unique scent, but I knew I would be sure to recognize it the next time I smelled it. It left such a lasting impression! I can now say I'm VERY happy to find this is the very same memorable fragrance! I really love it, but can't describe why. I guess it stimulates so many memories of good times with my friends that I have a strong attachment to this scent. I couldn't stand the idea of running out, so I bought the larger 3.4 oz. size! Thank you House of Jacomo for providing great scented memories for me and your many other patrons!",5
1081,"Jacomo is the sexiest scent I have ever smelled. Make me want to sniff my man and suck on his neck. Oh, by the way. It smells great on women too",5
1081,timeless great scent best over 30 years,5
1081,"It's different not like anything all the new colognes of today smell like. They all seem to smell like clones one another. Jocomo is a wonderful fragrance from yesteryear. It's one of a kind. Alluring, refreshing, and sophisticated.",5
1082,I have worn Jovan White Musk for Menfor over 30 years and have always been told I smell good.,5
1082,"OMG, Jovan White Musk for Men is so GREAT and so UNIQUE!!! I hope they never discontinue this. It smells great and smells like no other cologne out there. I love its freshness and vibrant feeling I get when I spray it on and get that first whiff. SO good!!!",5
1082,"Jovan White Musk for Men has been on my perfume shelves since my college days. Now that I'm working, it's my favorite everyday cologne. I can describe it as dangerously clean, smooth and sexy smelling perfume. I get so many hugs especially with my girl friends at the office. They said that I smell ""huggable"". I recommend this to anyone who likes a clean scent that is not overpowering.",5
1082,"I have always used the Jovan White Musk for Women and when I saw this I thought we would give it a try for my husband. I have to say it is vavavoom!!!! Ooooh, I really love this on him and he actually liked it too! Great choice for sublety, yet sexiness!!!",5
1082,"Jovan Musk White for men is a very pleasing everyday scent that I get many compliments on. Great product, good price and fast delivery! I use this or Jovan Musk Black everyday.",4
1083,Lovely shower gel by Sarah Jessica Parker is truly lovely. Cleans well & leaves a fresh scent behind that lasts for hours.,5
1084,"I LOVE,LOVE Mariah Carrey's collection..doesn't matter which one they are all great...but I have Luscious Pink,which is nearly gone..have just a bit left in the bottom,also have Dreams, and am ordering Ultra Pink body mist,and know it will smell great also..KEEP IT GOING MARIAH!",5
1084,A very soft scent will purchase again.,5
1084,Mariah Carey Ultra Pink is the best I love it it’s so subtle and sexy smelling everyone that gets close to me asks what do I have on and I tell them . Mariah did great job with the fragrance I love you Mariah . God bless her always .,5
1085,I love this fragrance. Compliments are continuous. ,5
1085,I have always worn expensive colognes. Parfums De Marly HEROD is by far the best I've worn. I get the most compliments on it. It stays on a lot longer and has a wonderful fragrance,5
1085,Herod by Parfums de Marly is an appealing fragrance that land me only one complement after wearing it for two weeks. It last throughout the day. The initial spray on is strong but then the dry down is relaxing. A better choice from the line is 'Carlisle'. ,3
1085,"Parfums de Marly's Herod is an awesome, pleasant scent that lasts a several hours on my skin. The next morning I could even smell its soft sweet aroma when I got in the shower. Worth every penny! ",5
1085,"Parfums De Marly one of the most natural Tobacco fragrances on the market...best for fall,and winter,and date night approved, and you can rock this dressed up, or down...you will get attention from this one!",5
1086,This was my first purchase of a Creed fragrance. I’m in love with Love and Black. Will order the tester again once the get it back in. ,5
1086,"I picked up a sweater, I had worn several days ago and once again was wrapped in Creed's lovely scent of Love in Black. I love it, my husband loves it, my daughter steals it from me and compliments from the public continue to come my way. What more needs to be said of such a classical scent--warm, sensuous, and sooo great!!",5
1086,"Love in black is unpredictable. When I first indulge in this fragrance I didn’t care for it. Ready to return it, 30 min into the fragrance the most beautiful unique scent Emerge. Nothing like I ever smell before. Long wearing fragrance just hit those pulse points. It’s a little Overbearing at first. After 30min of drying magic takes place. Very settle and beautiful fragrance. The compliments will start to pour in. Glad I made this purchase. Happy Customer:-)",5
1086,Creed Love in Black was a big hit when I gave it to my daughter for a birthday present and I couldn't beat the price Thanks!!!,5
1086,Classic! Stays on all day...will order again.,5
1087,David Beckham...Homme is a nice cologne......but it wears out quickly,4
1087,Smells like a cheaper version of Oud & bergamot from Jo Malone. Can’t go wrong at all for price point.,3
1087,I love the way smells in my husband.,5
1087,David beckham hommme has a light fragrance for any time. Great prices here also. ,5
1087,"It's a nice fragrance, i like it. It seems to dissolve quicker than other scents i've had. Otherwise i would recommend it for a light, citrusy scent. ",4
1088,Dolce Vita I been using since 1996 when my husband first brought it for me i haven't found anything like it since very unique ,5
1088,Yo uso dolce vita desde1994 es mi favorito y trato de que no se acabe ,5
1088,Dolce Vita. A wonderful scent. I receive more compliments when I am wearing this scent above all others,5
1088,Dolce Vita is my favourite perfume and I have been using it for years I always make sure that I never run out,5
1088,"I have been using this fragrance, Dolce Vita by Christian Dior, since 1997- to now 2018. I never changed it. When I wear it, all my family say you smell goooood and smell same all the time. You will always hear nice comments from the youngest to oldest. You must try it to understand.",5
1089,I absolutely LOVE this perfume. It's not too heavy and it's perfect to wear all year around. I definitely recommend this perfume to every woman. ,5
1089,I love this fragrance I had some a few years ago I got at Ulta. I guess they stop selling it so I'm so thankful for Frangrace Net. It last all day and I always get compliments on it.,5
1089,"I just discovered Especially Escada around Christmas time and I fell in love with it. it's not too harsh of a smell and it doesn't overwhelm you. I always get stopped where ever I am & get asked what kind of perfume I'm wearing. One lady even had me write the name of the perfume so she could buy it the next day. I have officially become a Escada fan for life. I love how light it smells,how you can wear it all year & it does not overwhelm the user or people around them. Thank you for hipping me to especially Escada. That is the only perfume I will ever wear. ",5
1089,Let me start by saying this bottle is beautiful! Looks great on any vanity tray. Plus the juice inside is equally as gorgeous. This is grown lady perfume. Sophisticated and sexy. It's also long lasting.,5
1089,"I've been using Escada for a long time and will continue using it. It is my favorite, elegant, fresh, just perfect. In love with it.",5
1090,Love all of escada products it lasts all day long always get a lot of complements when wearing his products ,5
1090,Taj sunset is another one of my tops i have about 6 its wonderful smells sooooo good ,5
1090,I like Escape perfume. It's light and not too obtrusive. I work with a woman who is very sensitive to smells. She never comments when I wear it.,4
1090,I love Escada products but Taj Sunset is my favorite and has been for years. it smells nice regardless of the season. Would love to have this as a body lotion and body wash if it were available. I am not just sold on the product I have been pleased thus far with this company and will continue to do business with them. ,4
1090,"This is hands down my favorite fragrance EVER !! I also ordered the larger bottle, still a bit pricier than the other two perfumes I ordered as a rotation, but it's Escada not only is it worth it I AM WORTH IT. I feel as though I have found a wonderful jewel with this company, price, quality and everything was shipped well and in a timely manner. Thank you and looking forward to doing business with you again.",4
1091,Such a beautiful and captivating scent! Truly in love with this one,5
1091,"This was a blind buy, basing my purchase on reviews. I’m not quite sure if it is a scent for me. I tend to favor the gourmand scents. Narciso by Narciso Rodriguez is possibly too powdery for me. If you like powdery then this is one for you. ",4
1091,"Its been along time im waiting for this narciso eau de parfum.. very elegant smell! Only the bottle its too heavy, i cant see if more or finished already the bottle.. hope they can make a lighter bottle for this kind of parfum.. i like this smell because always remind me Tova parfum which i love the most but i dnt think fragrance carry TOVA... ",5
1091,I love this scent!,5
1091,I love this scent! ,5
1092,"I don't really wear a lot of perfume due to headaches/allergies but tease is quite different. I bought myself the mini bottle & it worked out perfectly. A soft warm floral,with a hint of fruit just the way I like it,and whoever is in my presence gives me positive vibes or nice compliments on it. I think maybe I'll consider buying the bigger bottle soon,seeing that I got no bad reactions at all.",5
1092,Tease is 1 of my favorite perfumes I have to keep in rotation. Super soft but very noticeable...got many compliments throughout the day.,4
1092,"I tried fairy dust and I found it too strong smelling. I was quite disappointed because I loved the bottle design & I thought perhaps the scent would be just as good on me,but sadly it wasn't. Tease,however,is a whole lot better. I kept wearing it and with time,it really developed into a warm comforting scent that made me feel sexy and confident in my own skin. ",5
1092,"This tease fragrance is wonderful. I love the way it lingers after I've taken off my clothes to go and shower. I am an older woman and believe me,many people were surprised to know that I was wearing a Paris Hilton brand usually meant for young girls/women. I think perfume in general should never be restricted to a certain age group,it's all a matter of personal preference and that's why I've chosen this one.",5
1092,Paris Hilton Tease is great for the office and night out on the town.,5
1093,"Great fragrance. Very elegant,not too much but enough to carry on through those special evenings. Someone said it smells similar to Happy but I'm not so sure if that's accurate. It's really a fragrance all on it's own.",5
1093,I think this perfume is sexy for evening wear it's sensual and classy. ,5
1094,I like DE LA RENTA lotion ,4
1094,"I have been an Oscar De La Rente for such a long time, but the above product I purchase recently is not my favorite. I would not buy it again.I will continue to buy Oscar De La Rente'(De La Renta body lotion).B.R. Johnson.",2

1094,"So de la rente body lotion is fabulous!!! My Mother and Aunt raised me as an Oscar De La Renté woman!!! They only wore Oscar and I do, also. This fragrance is very soft yet enticing. As my mother would say.....”Oscar women are very special! Real ladies. ",5
1095,This is my summer fragrance. So clean and fresh. Perfect for summertime. Reminds of the beach. ,5
1095,Very unique soft but intense at the same time. Perfect for the summer. ,5
1095,"This is quite similar to Muelhens 4711, which costs 10% of Tom Ford's retail price and has a nearly identical scent. ",3
1095,The perfume of this tom ford is lovely and fresh and lasts practically all day. Only disadvantage is buying the bottle is very expensive! So i get just testers instead. ,5
1095,Smell clean and have a long lasting ,4
1096,Versace Dylan Blue is one of the best . I am pleased with the product extremely. This purchase is verified real. With a great price from fragrancenet. I want to order more. The shipping was quick and delivered. I will purchase all my fragrances from fragrancenet.,5
1097,this perfume is very nice it smells like chance by chanel I really love it very classy and it last,5
1097,Vince camuto femme is my go to. Its soft yet strong and lasts all day. The zing from the pepper makes it different and enchanting. I'd say it's for women over 40 as it's not sweet at all. More sophicated than other scents.,5
1097,Vince Camuto Femme is one of my favorite perfumes. It has a really pretty different floral scent and it has great lasting power. I hope this doesn't get discontinued.,5
1097,"I love Vince Camuto Femme. It's a really pretty scent that lasts a long time. It's a fresh, clean floral with a little spice. I think it's an amazing perfume and I wear it for day, evening and special occasions. I'm frequently asked what I'm wearing and told I smell really good.",5
1097,"This smells awful!!! I would never order again, yuck!",1
1098,"Written in your many reviews on YVRESSE BETTER KNOWN (TO ME) CHAMPAGNE. I'M A JAZZ VOCALIST WITH MANY JAZZ GROUPS IN SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA. SO MANY COMPLIMENTS BY THIS BEAUTIFUL SCENT .

1098,keep making the Yvress I have being wearing since the beginning when it was called Champagne. It's one of the best perfumes there is nothing like it. Dimi 6.2.19,5

1099,"Love this perfume, a beautiful fresh smell without being heavy. I always get comments on how nice I smell. Wish it was sold in a perfume not just toilette ",5

1102,"Victoria Secret's Very Sexy I am a big perfume collector, and out of all the bottles I own; this is my husband's absolute favorite. I feel like the scent lasts throughout the day and I always get several compliments .",5
1102," Victoria's Secrets Very Sexy fragrance is by far the most amazing scent I have ever put on my skin. For years I was a dedicated Perry Ellis 360° fan, from high school in the 90s till I discovered VS in 2014 & I will stay loyal to just the pair into my middle age.",5
1102,The bottle of Very Sexy that I received is HUGE! I thought I was getting a deal on the regular bottle! I'm more than happy. Thank you!!,5
1102,This was a gift for my daughter-in-law but she loves it and has worn it for several years so my review was per her comments. Nice price and fragrance (Victoria's Secret Very Sexy) arrived quickly. She wears this in the evening and it is not overwhelming.,5
1102,"Pleasant perfume, smells really nice. But it didn't last but a second on my skin.",2
1103,"Vince Camuto has some great releases and this is another great release from the house. The saffron and the mint stand out for me in this blind-buy. This is not your typical citrus, woody and spicy masculine fragrance because of the saffron and mint; which make this fragrance light and refreshing. The citrus doesn't stick around on the dry-down, and I think that's a good thing. 7 / 10 for me only because this becomes a skin scent after 4 - 6 hours (which I'm not all to fussed about).",4
1103,I bought this as a birthday gift to myself 2 years ago and absolutely loved it. Have been experimenting with other’s but I’ll be coming back to this in a few months.,5
1103,Vince Camuto Eterno is something you wear during a summer morning or spring ! Patchuli scent is subtle and there are mint and flower notes! Great fragrance! The only problem is that it doesn't last too long and it does not project like others! maybe 2 good to three hours! 4 stars!!! ,4
1103,Love this smell so much. Can't really explain other than it smells expensive and not overbearing or sweet. ,5
1103,"I am very brand loyal and think that Mont Blanc's Legend is one of the best colognes (as well as Burberry London), but I smelled Eterno in an Esquire magazine and I had to have it. And trust me, after I got it in the mail today it didn't dissapoint! This may be my number one favorite cologne! So many men's colognes smell so sweet nowadays and I hate it. But Eterno rose to the top of my top-3 list and I'm afraid they'll discontinue it because I looked at seven different stores in three different cities and did not find this. I ordered two bottles and want to order two more!! This is one of those scents that will cause people to ask what you're wearing - for sure. Instant classic. ",5
1104,"This is the ONLY scent from this line that I like. Sweet, fruity everyday scent..of course it doesn't last long, but it smells good",3

1107,"Eau De Gaga is not your typical sweet smelling scent with which many celebrities are associated. It leans unisex and is a mature ( not grandma) fragrance that is quite pleasant, but not long lasting. You might want to reapply after 3 or 4 hours and because it is reasonably priced, one can afford to do just that.",4
1107,Lady Gaga Eau De Gaga is Amazing! I was not sure how anything could come close to her Fame line......But she has yet another Hit Fragrance on her hands for sure:),5

I don't normally like sweet / fruity scents that much Then, I started to get the powdery / musky notes that I love in perfumes, with a hint of the floral. Several hours later, my wrists smell pretty and soft. Totally worth the purchase, ladies, and looks nice on the counter, too! I may not wear it every day, but I will on nights I want to smell sexy and warm, like a night of dancing.",4

1115,This fragrance is an oldie but goody. I must have 50 colognes and this had to be one of them. If you like to smell good you can't go wrong with Bowling Green.,5
1116,"Bvlgari fragrances have always been my most attention getting and complimented colognes I have worn. I recently was in need of a cologne and purchased a Bvlgari Soir at a big name department store. After that 2 days later I decided to buy the Bvlgari Extreme (my favorite) on FragranceNet and also a Bvlgari aftershave balm. It arrived within 4 days - NO shipping fees. Also to note: The package was exact from the big name department store. ALSO the spray nozzle was in the same position as the big name department store. So there is no doubt in my mind FragranceNet Also the nozzle attachment had the same ""feel and give"" as the store. FragranceNet is definitely my site! >>> More on Bvlgari Extreme - it is fresh and clean but also deep and woody - sexy at the core. The lavender brings it all together and brings in the compliments and attention. It is a classic. New scents on the market are too bubble gum scented or too detergent smelling. GO WITH A CLASSIC - Bvlgari Pour Homme, Extreme, and Soir (the latter is the more subdued.) Try the Aqua in the summer and it will not disappoint. ",5
1116,I know this perfume I use it before it really good ,5

If you look like you're that old, then I guess you might as well smell like it. A modern and sophisticated scent... if you can find it... is Explorer. But not many scents are less expensive than Canoe, whereas the newer scents are often more than $10 per ounce.",5

OMG I bought 2 bottles of it and will probably buy another two bottles. I was told that they quit making this scent. I was thrilled that I found it and it was such a great price. I ordered it to make sure it wasn’t a knock off. Boy I’m so so happy. It’s the real deal. Please don’t stop selling this perfume and it u do please tell me so I can stock up on a whole bunch of it lol . No really I will buy as much as I can. It is such a beautiful smell.

1138,"Royal Bain de Caron was called Champagne de Caron...before some type of lawsuit. My father adored this fragrance and so did my mother. Then I started wearing it and have done so for many years. It is sweet but not sappy...more like honey. I have no education in fragrance (nose) but I also find it amber(y)...just warm and enveloping. Don't let the price fool you, this fragrance is made the way ""real"" fragrances are made, without all the fake ingredients that the newer ones are made now: headache. Not sure that I'm helping anyone by my review, fragrances are very personal. So, for me I wear this because: 1) I love it :) and 2) I love wearing it for sentimental reasons: both my parents wore this off and on and it reminds me of their embrace.",5
1138,"I remember as a little kid (I’m a guy) living in Vietnam (my American father fought in the war), my (Vietnamese) mother sometimes would drop a few drops of a cologne in her hands and rub them on my head and my brothers' heads when we go out to special events. I’ve never forgotten the scent but didn’t know the name. We returned to the US during the Vietnam War and she was never able to find this perfume. 20 years later, I was visiting Paris and while there, I went to a big perfume store. I smelled every single bottle in the store and came across one that I’m sure it’s the one!!! It was Royal Bain de Champagne by Caron. I bought it and gave it to my mother and wow!!! it was the one!! My mother passed away 10 years ago this month and I still have the half-used bottle when she passed away. When I miss her, I put some on and I would feel like she is here with me. This smell is classic!!! I didn't realize that it's unisex!! I have always thought that it was perfume for women.",5
1138,"I like it, smells good",4
1138,"I have been wearing Royal Bain Caron Champagne since 1978 it has a magnificent fragrance, that is light, sweet and very smooth sent to it, that nothing else smells like it, it stays with you all day long. It comes in a champagne cologne bottle that looks like a real champagne bottle, I would have stop people from drinking it sometimes, some of them would actually go and get a glass and would be ready to pour it. Greg from Oh-10",5

1140,I'm a cologne-aholic. I buy thousands of dollars a year on fragrances. I keep up with what's in and trending in the smell good world. I usually never buy the same thing twice. To me they smell good at the time. But Givenchy edt.? I've been wearing this cologne almost 20 years. I've never gotten more compliments from any other fragrance. Givenchy stops people in their tracks. I've had men and women walk past me and do a turnaround. Downside is that it doesn't last long. ,4
1140,The sent is smooth sweet fruitful something that last a light bold smell,4
1140,"Givenchy has a clean crisp sent that is not over powering so it can be worn in the office, church, or any public area without being offensive.",5

1140," This is my personal favorite at the moment. To me, it smells like sour grapefruit and sweet watermelon with a woodsy cedar back note. For the price it's hard to find anything that gets compliments and inquiries that this one does. Worth every penny.",5
1141,Love it. Love it. Love it.,5
1142,Lalique white EDT....a very solid spring frag...not a beast mode fragrance...this is something you reapply throughout the day...fresh/clean smell...go heavy on overspray a must on initial spray....you will not smell offensive or harsh,3

1142,LaLique White is a signature scent for me along with Tom Ford Grey Vetiver. It has the fragrance of a stylish and classy man. Love the scent. I wish there was an aftershave to match.

I hope they NEVER discontinue this gem in the Aqua Allegoria line. Now, if they would only bring back Lavande Velours (such a beautiful fresh-cut lavender fragrance, very French)! A+",5
1146,"Very good, refreshing and delicious!",5
1146,"My husband just bought me the Aqua Allegoria Herba Fresca by Guerlain. I had asked a waitress in a restaurant that we were at what she was wearing as it smelled so fresh, like a newly mowed field of flowers. This is one of the freshest fragrances I have found & my husband really likes it. It has an amazing odor of fresh cut grass & flowers without being so overpowering. Love it!",5
1146,"I have used Herba Fresca for a number of years and never tire of it. Well named, it is fresh and outdoorsy .it does not have heavy floral overtones and is appropriate for any occasion. It is not so commonly available here and people often comment on it when meeting me and ask what it is. I recently bought a bottle each of it for my 19 year old grand-daughters as they like it so much. A truly beautiful fragrance. G ",5

1159,I have been wearing it for a long time. And the price was amazing,5
1159,"Philosophy Pure Grace: This has been my favorite fragrance for over a decade. The first explanation that I came up with when first spraying this onto my arm is ""CLEAN."" I'm not kidding and everyone who loves it uses the SAME adjective when they describe this scent. It is light, fun, subdued, (not overwhelming), and clean - crisp like fresh laundry taken down after a day in sunshine! If you can, try to get the matching bath/shower gel to use with this fragrance. It also has the matching lotion, which I also love. But the creme de la creme of this family of Pure Grace is the Pure Grace Satin Body Oil! Oh, la la! It is a spray that you use after showering or bathing and it moisturizes your skin with the same light fragrance of Pure Grace. This is one collection in which all of the products are winners!",5
1159,"Philosophy Pure Grace is one of my favorite scents due to its soapy skin smell. I love anything that smells like Ivory soap. I only wish it lasted much longer; it seems to fade (on me, at least) quickly. It's perfect if you're going to be in close proximity to others, i.e. a meeting or in the dentist's chair. Impossible to offend anyone with this particular scent. Others that are similar are Perry Ellis 360°, Design, Clean Skin, Clean Ultimate, and Bobbie Brown's Bare.",5

1161,"Vera Wang Anniversary is to powerful a scent for me. I prefer Sheer Veil. It's a fragrance that you smell before the person wearing it gets close to you. That's too much. A sexy fragrance should only be smelled when up close and personal, not 10 feet away. ",3
1161,Vera Want Anniversary ! Amazing - ,5

1165,"Luv luv luv! Dior Addict (pink) makes u feel so pretty. Its such a steal on this site especially if u are used to purchacing it at a counter. I do have to spray it on a little heavier than my other perfumes so that it lasts all day, but its totally worth it!",5
1165,"Dior makes the best perfumes. I was hooked on Blooming Bouquet until I came across Addict. The full Addict perfume is nice, but it's a bit heavy. The fraische is wonderful. It's engaging like the full perfume without being overpowering. Wonderful for daily wear. ",5
1165,"I always receive compliments when I wear Addict 2 in the pink bottle. The blue bottle Addict is too strong. It's my ""go to"" perfume. I have been wearing it for years.",5
1166,"When I saw that Royal Secret was once again available, I grabbed 4 bottles of it. As soon as I sprayed it on, I knew that it was not the original fragrance that I loved.

1166,"For 53 yrs. I have been wearing Royal Secret. We are out of it now and nothing tried has taken it place. It makes no sense to us why they would discontinue the original Monteil formula. Our grandchildren always said ""smells like grandma"" now they have no comments. It just shows that big companies are not concerned with product loyality. Susan Clue",5
1167,Escada Sentiment is one of my very favorite fragrances of all time. Wish I could still find it in the stores. Was glad to find it here.,5

1180,Love this stuff! This is a very clean soapy scent. Lasts long and not overpowering. Definitely a unisex fragrance! ,5
1180,This smells great on women also. My signature scent always has been Mugler Cologne and this is similar but slightly better than MC. I purchased a large sample on ebay just to try it first and it really can be successfully worn by a woman too. It is def unisex.,5
1180,Creed Vetiver...I’ve had maybe 7-8 refills of this scent since I was told about it...it’s a great scent...ladies love it and it’s become my signature fragrance...if you haven’t had the opportunity to smell this beautiful scent...you’re missing out!,5
1180,I love creed vetiver ,5
1181,Love this fragrance so much! This is my go to fragrance that smells of sophistication and confidence!,5
1181,"I try a lot of samples and this one L'Ambre Des Merveilles I never heard of decided to give it a try. To my amazement it smells really good and sensual; but, the smell dies down later. ",4
1181,"L'Ambre des Merveilles EDP is not for me. A liitle too intense. Reminds me of Opium fragrance. Like other Hermes a lot like Hermes Jour, Absolu, Eau des Merveilles Elixer EDP.",2
1181,This smells marvelous! It smells so good! It smell expensive!,5
1181,"L'Ambre de Merveilles is right up there with the very best if you are a vanilla lover. Warm and sensuous, it resembles the original Tocade in the drydown.",5
1182,michael kors 24 karat brilliant gold is one of my favorites. So glad I found a place to get it cheaper ,5
1182,"MK Gold Brilliant has now become my favorite!!! I’ve been wearing Jessica McClintoch original for years, but this one has the softest freshest smell and last’s all day! I get asked what am I wearing often?The same elluring sent as with my Jessica!!",5
1182,OMM!!! Michael Kors 24 Brilliant Gold is the absolute best!,5
1182,"The Michael Kors 24k Brilliant Gold to me smells of Gardenia. I LOVE IT! From the description of the product, I was expecting this scent, but I could not be happier! ",5
1182,tried it on a tester in Walmart and people kept asking me what cologne I was wearing! Rushed home and went to Fragrance Net and ordered it! It is a subtle but sophisticated scent and as the day wears on it mellows to a soft cloud of scent. One of the best I have tried in years. Would recommend also trying Jimmy Choo...both are excellent scents that you will use to the last drop. ,5
1183,Antonio Banderas is the best perfume for Man OMG make me crazy,5
1183,"If you ever want to feel sexy, ladies, this is it. & it's the kind of sexy without the spice...it's like a beautiful, soft, ALMOST powdery raspberry cherry...uh..it's fabulous.",5
1183,"I ordered this for a friend and she's so selective and out of five different samples, this was her favorite! ",5
1183,ALL I can say is OMG I love Ralph Romance so I had to TRY this one again Midnight Romance I am in love and LADIES my husband said the scent was ADDICTING and he COULD NOT take his hands off me.. I WILL B GETTING MORE,5
1183,Midnight Romance is another of my lovely perfume I have..... it’s very soft but long lasting. ,5
1184,This is a master piece in my eyes.I have placed three orders i am a smell good guy i woood send my friends good deals and NO PROBLEMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
1185,"Ever since my boyfriend bought me Obsession Gift Set for Christmas years ago, every man, woman & teenager have complimented that fragrance (eau de cologne) & body lotion (I wear on my arms & hands everyday before I go out). I do one spray of eau de cologne on each side of my neck. Although I can't smell it everyone else does from morning till late at night (the smell lingers) even when I perspire in the summer. I had a man from work who borrowed my Obsession so that his wife could try it. He wanted to see if she smelled as great as I did & she did so he bought her the Christmas set (eau de cologne & body lotion) for the holiday. It's just amazing how many people love it. After so many years of wearing it I would occasionally try something else that I loved but only one girlfriend loved it like I did.. I wear it sometimes but my boyfriend prefers the Obsession. Seems he's ""obsessed"" by it. lol",5
1185,"This lotion could be a little stronger in fragrance. A little too subtle for me, but nice on the skin.",3
1185,I have wore Obsession perfume and it's powder and lotion for years and I mean years. I am 64 and often get positive feedback on how great it smells on me. I love to layer it. ,3
1185,I have used Obsession perfume for many years but it's not easy to find the lotion. I love the lotion as much as the perfume and I would recommend it to others. The lotion is not overpowering.,5
1186,"Guy:What perfume are you wearing ? Me: Pitbull Guy: You are wearing a fragrance named after a dog? Not everyone can do a fragrance. Celebrities will put their name to anything, just to make $$ ",2
1186,Pitbull is awesome the smell is awesome i will continue to order this product,5
1186,"I purchased Pitbull for me - it smells wonderful! Everyone complimented me on the scent, lasted all day, very soft scent.",5

1187,Perfect wedding scent very nice and fast shipping especially over the weekend!!! And thanks for all the gifts :),5
1187,"Salvatore Ferragamo really outperformed himself with Uomo Casual Life. This fragrance is phenomenal. The musky, woody, lemon scents, don't forget Cardamom, tops this fragrance. It stays with you a long time and makes me small edible. ",5
1187,"Uomo Casual is unique because it gives that tiramisu-like smell a fresh twist to make it work for spring and early fall. If you’re a gourmand lover looking for something appropriate in the warmer weather, this is it. Lasts about 4-6 hours on my skin.",5
1187,Salvatore Ferragamo casual life cologne is intoxicating without being heavy a great cologne for summer. Actually it's a great cologne for daytime anytime.,5
1187,I just got this fragrance was very impressed. Tho its more of a summer early fall fragrance with hints of fresh notes and slightly musky. I was pleasantly impressed. Usually dont do very wrong with Salvatore ,5
1188,"Tom Ford Oud Wood Intense: Short term reaction is, I like it! Potent and exotic fragrance profile, with sophistication. After the dry down, its overtones remind me a bit of Cristobal by Balenciaga, now discontinued, which I miss a lot.",4
1188,Tom Ford Oud Wood Intense: Too metallic for me but I'll try a few more wear to see if it will take getting aquired too.,2
1188,"Compliments after compliments. Worn it the same day I received it, luckily it came early in the afternoon, and I received many compliments from women everywhere! I usually don’t write reviews but I make purchases based off reading them, and since there’s a lack of comments on Tom Ford Oud Wood Intense on this site, I thought I’d give my input.",5
1188,one of my favorite cologne ever ,5
1188,"Amazing! It might take other people some getting used to. Once its worn on the skin, this thing is a beast! The dry down gets the ladies.",5
1189,Love love it Trésor La Nuit si Amazing everybody always say that is a awesome smell get all my perfumes from fragrance net love the website,5
1189,"I tried this fragrance months ago and always wanted it in my collection and everywhere I went it was out of stock, so I ordered it there and I am 110% satisfied with the product, smells so good and this perfume is a must! My fav of Lancôme for sure!",5
1189,LA NUIT LOVE THIS GET SO MANY COMPLIMENTS WHEN I WEAR IT FROM MEN AND WOMEN ,5
1189,La Nuit is one of my favorite all time perfumes! It lasts so long and is so unique! It’s a scent I can’t describe because it’s so good. Definitely my favorite fall and winter perfume. I think it’s too strong for spring and summer. Worth every penny! ,5
1189,I was sceptical from ordering perfume online... however I was proven wrong. This is amazing. Super fast shipping (although tracking isn’t super accurate) authentic and amazing packaging. Love! The scent is my all time fav ❤️,5
1191,My husband’s all time favorite ,5
1192,Bought this and was very surprised very powdery scent definitely a winter scent,4
1192,"I picked this fragrance gift set on sales for $35.00 at a retailers. I cannot believe the cost they have it here... This is a total still... This is a very soft powdery fragrance with 10+ hours staying power. This smell is not flowery, so I would say it belongs in the Donna Karan Cashmere Mist family of scents. I am so glad that they have it here for under $20.00 AMAZING!!!!",5
1192,Ellen Tracy Bronze smells so great. Very clean and soft and I get compliments whenever I wear it. Some scents smell too strong and wet but this smells baby powder fresh and clean. Love it.,5
1192,"Love this fragrance. Smells almost like baby powder, very clean and subtle. Wear it everyday and get alot of compliments.",5
1192,"I liked the smell. ' I wouldn't say it's my favorite one, but definatly I would wear it, if I get it as a present.",3
1194,Wearing Fracas for forty years and still get compliments. However the price has gone through the roof!!,5
1194,"FRACAS, IRONICALLY HAS THAT NAME, SINCE ON THE CONTRARY IS THE MOST DELICIOUS AND OLDEST PERFUME FROM FRANCE...PARIS. VERY FEW WOMEN KNOW ABOUT IT... BUT THIS IS A CLASSIC... AND VERY RECOGNIZABLE BY WHO HAS USED IT BEFORE... BECAUSE IS UNIQUE.. KNEW ABOUT IF ON A TRIP FROM SAN JUAN TO EUROPE ON AIR FRANCE ONE OF THE MOST ELEGANT STEWARDESS WAS WEARING IT..",5
1194,"Fracas is spectacular. I first found it over thirty years ago when it was re-distributed (it originated in the twenties, I think). There are two fragrances I've gotten nothing but complements on in my almost seventy years on earth -- one is the original Chloe and the other is Fracas. As long as I can find Fracas, which seems to have almost magical qualities, I'll wear it! It's elegant, sensual, and unique. My drama students can identify me just by my Fracas (we've tried identifying each other with eyes closed in class). When I put it on in the morning, my husband always tells me how good I smell. Wearing it makes me feel just a little bit special. It's just the best.",5
1194,"I was introduced to Fracas in the 80's. Every time I wore it, someone would say, ""You smell delicious, what are you wearing?"" And still today strangers will come up to me and ask what fragrance I am wearing. It is my signature fragrance. I loved it in the 80's and I love it still.",5
1194,"Fracas is the greatest perfume ever created. The descriptions for it on this website, and some others, leave out the fact that it's the perfect Tuberose scent - gorgeous, ripe, lush, sensual, TUBEROSE, dominates the perfume. There are a million things said about Fracas, it's a legendary scent, and it more than lives up to the legend. It's not heavy, but it's intense. It's sweet but fresh, it's elegant but also very sexy, it's so amazing, and perfect for me, I have a visceral reaction to it. My only problem with the fabulous Fracas is the outrageous price! Thank you Fragrancenet for your amazing discounts, selection, and service!",5
1195,Smells good and love it,5
1196,"My first bottle after a friend introduced me to it,now it will be the first of many",5
1196,Insolence is the only one ☝,5
1196,"I sarted using Insolence about 12 years ago. Since that time, I've worn nothing else, nothing compares.",5
1196,Insolence by Guerlain is a sweet n romantic smell... I have been looking out to buy it but saw d reviews on Shalimar and decided to go for it but I regretted my decision.. Right now I got my insolence and I so love it far more dan Shalimar.. Dis is my first try and I love it so much I will recommend ,5
1196,Insolence is only one of my favorite (new fav) of the House of Guerlain. I have faithfully worn different Guerlain scents over the years - I adore their longer lasting unqiue aromas. If you want to stand out - make a statement - or be remembered by your scent - definitely go Guerlain. This Insolence by Guerlain has me excited and feeling very beautiful.,5
1197,L'eau Bleue D'lssey Pour Homme is the best spray ive had,5
1197,L'Eau Bleue My absolute favorite for my boyfriend. Sexy...not too earthy. Just makes me crazy. Hard to find anymore. Hope it isn't discontinued. What a tragedy that would be. LoveLoveLove❣,5
1197,L'eau Bleue D'Issey Pour Homme is not the perfect cologne for men. Kinda sweet and sourish at the same time. It does have staying power. ,2

1198,"Roberto Cavalli Paradiso, eau de parfum. What can I say, I was introduced to this several years ago and it is my signature fragrance, just adore it.",5
1198,This is a wonderful perfume that lasts for hours. My office mate wore it to work and left trails of this wonderfully heady fragrance everywhere she went in the office. It makes you imagine you are in a tropical paradise with a beach and pool enjoying the sun while sipping an exotic cocktail. It is like going on vacation just wearing it.,5
1199,Why is it only available in 1.5 Oz? Great cologne !,5
1199,"Stetson Black: Love to apply right after a long shower, after a hard day at work... I wear it for me... ",5
1199,"Stetson Black is not an easy fragrance to find in stores, so I am very pleased to be able to come to this site & be able to purchase it. It is one of my favorite masculine fragrances. Woodsy, yet sporty and still sophisticated enough for a night on the town. I just want to glue myself to my mans side when he's wearing it! It smells THAT good!",5
1200,"24 Faubourg is a sophisticated and complex fragrance. I first smelled recently on a woman shopping next to me. Following her, I had to ask what she was wearing. It was 24 Faubourg. I couldn't get the scent out of my head, so I ordered it here. This is not your ""typey"" predictable fragrance at mid-range department stores, where they all smell pretty similar. It comes on bold, so you just need one spray. Then it settles into a subtle jasmine floral with smouldery sensual notes. It's quite captivating yet not overbearing. Feminine yet confident. Love it! ",5
1200,Excellent...always. 24 Faubourg by Hermes,5
1200,"My favorite perfume ever! Gorgeous, elegant and sexy",5
1200,"Have been enjoying 24 Faubourg for years now and often receive positive comments from strangers including men which often surprises me. Used to use Caleche, another lovely Hermes product, until a friend put me onto 24 F. Love them both. Classy and not overwhelming but hovers.",5
1200,"I have been searching for a French fragrance to match my old favorite, which is no longer is production. At last! Yesterday, I found 24 Faubourg, and I am in love. The scent reminds me of pearls, diamonds, and mink, or blue jeans and a floppy cotton sweater. Beautiful, sophisticated, unique. I will not smell this fragrance all over America, as it is uncommonly special and very French.",5
1201,EXCELLTAngel pure malt is like nothing other.,5
1201,"As they say for some alcoholic beverages, let it sit. I didn’t know what to make of this scent when I first got it. I let it sit in my cologne cabinet for about two weeks. Came back and tried it and was blown away! It came off sweet and seductive. More of the latter. Awesome fragrance!",5
1201,If you don't have you must add it to your collection. On point my top 5 ,5
1201,Angel pure malt is like nothing other.,5
1201,I love it .,5
1202,"Burberry Sport is an excellent scent and last for along time(even though the person wearing it can't smell it anymore, everyone else will and ask what perfume that is!!",5
1202,My hubby loves Burberry Sport and wears it along(not at same time but changes it up when he feels like it0 with CK Eternity. They are manly scents and make any guy smell like a million buck.

1202,I will admit I did not try before I buy but Burberry sport was very good.,5
1203,The perfume is a dream ,5
1203,"Lalique Amethyst Eclat is a lovely fresh, floral scent. The Black Current adds just enough sweetness to the scent making it very feminine. I get complements every time I wear it. So fresh, floral and feminine.",5
1203,"This a fragrance that invariably someone on an crowded elevator says 'Who smells so nice?'. Lalique Amethyst Eclat is lovely, light and lasting - at least on me. My new favorite.",5

1206,"I wear Burberry Body Gold Limited Edition and I am male. I like it because of the added note of wormwood which, essentially, turns this magnificent fragrance into a unisex fragrance. Although it is a ""Limited Edition,"" I hope that is just the name and that Burberry continues manufacturing this excellent scent long into the future (like some of their other fragrances). I also with they'd bring back both the original Burberrys for Men (the ""first original"" with the gold offset cap in the rectangular bottle with curved sides that smelled sharp and herbal, and the ""second original,"" the one with the blue cabochon on top which smelled sweet and woodsy.",5
1206,Burberry Body Gold is such a sexy sensuous fragrance. Every Woman should have this scent in their collection!!,5
1206,Burberry body gold perfume is my all time favorite but hard to find. Always available on FragranceNet and it’s original! It’s always discounted here and the delivery is fast and prompt.

Fast forward to internet sharing and searching I found, ordered and received my two bottle gift set, that will probably last me until I shuffle off the Halston scented mortal coil. Nothing but good words for the brand, this website and my own Halston Z-14 scented future.",5

1214,I love Must De Cartier. My husband bought this for me back in the 80's. I haven't had any since that ran out. I just ordered this for my birthday and I love it.,5
1214,"Must de Cartier was introduced before 1987, which is when I started wearing it. It was later reintroduced with a slightly different scent, the difference being almost indiscernible but the packaging is completely different. The original parfum was in black and gold packaging and is now considered “vintage”. It is still a beautiful, exotic scent and retains much of the original quality.",5
1214,"The original Must de Cartier Parfum was actually first introduced in 1981 not 1996. They have changed the formula a bit but for me it still the best fragrance out there. I've been wearing it for 37 years and still get asked regularly what I'm wearing. In the old days, I would act like I didn't remember what I had put on that day because I didn't want anyone to copy my scent. I agree with Dolly, men especially love it. I wouldn't consider wearing anything else. Anyone that knows me knows that this is my scent. Even though they changed the formula, I love it as much as I did the first time I discovered it all those years ago.",5
1214,"Must de Cartier is a necessity that once, was a luxury. It is impossible to put into words how amazing this parfum smells. I have worn this fragrance for so long that I am somewhat 'noseblind' to it - but it is the only one I'll wear. Thank you for continuing to carry Must de Cartier, it is not that easy to find, and I am appreciative, Sincerely, Kate ",5
1214,This fragrance was introduced in the 70's - I bought my first bottle in Paris when I was a TWA flight attendant and have worn it since.,5
1215,It has always been my husband's favorite aftershave. His Christmas gift every year.,5
1215,Strong scent which lasts through the day which is not typical for an aftershave. ,4
1215,paco rabanne after shave lotion is the best after shave lotion I have ever used it leaves my face smooth and not dry like others Wilbur Wright.,5
1216,"I have worn nothing but Raffinee for 40 years, it is ME, please don't ever quit making it!",5
1216,Since they changed the look of Raffinee it smells like White Diamonds stronger than what Raffinee use to smell like.,1
1216,Raffinee is not the same anymore. When I first purchased it it was the Raffinee I wore for 41 years since they change the look it is not the same. It is stronger than before. I am wearing it because I have 2 botttles of it I wish they would take a look at there product and bring the right scent back.,1
1216,"I have been wearing Raffinee for 41 years it is the only perfume that I like it is not a strong scent it is perfect. I was not able to find it for awhile until I found FragranceNet, and I hope that you will carry it all the time. ",5

1219,"Every time I wear it women love it, and ask what it is even when they just get near me.",5
1219,A old girlfriend bought this for me and I didn't want to use it but after a few times I found out that very sexy for him is worth the price. my current Girlfriend uses it on the pillows when I am on my overnights with the EMS. ;-) ,4
1219,I love and so does my man. Like the bottle says it is Very Sexy. I love the way it smells on him.,5
1220,Love the smell of English Lavender Body Spray but the fragrance does not last very long. Don't know if I would buy it again for that reason. The hand soap is great and the fragrance does last a long time.,2

At one of the small fragrance stands in the mall, I smelled a lot of the designer colognes and this is the one that stood out to me. I get a tropical vibe from this scent, more so than probably any of my other fragrances. Different than anything else I own, and nice to have in my collection.",5
1224,"GUESS SUEDE Think light creamy sweet suede. It's a warm and pleasing scent. Disregard the top notes, they don't stay for long and heart of the fragrance is really in the lower notes. I bought a sample here at fragrancenet for a buck and change and I plan to get a tester bottle on my next order. It is a inexpensive way to add to my collection. ",5

At one of the small fragrance stands in the mall, I smelled a lot of the designer colognes and this is the one that stood out to me. I get a tropical vibe from this scent, more so than probably any of my other fragrances. Different than anything else I own, and nice to have in my collection.",5
1225,"GUESS SUEDE Think light creamy sweet suede. It's a warm and pleasing scent. Disregard the top notes, they don't stay for long and heart of the fragrance is really in the lower notes. I bought a sample here at fragrancenet for a buck and change and I plan to get a tester bottle on my next order. It is a inexpensive way to add to my collection. ",5
1226,I like it and enjoy it. Great scent but no compliments from anyone on it so don't know if it's a crowd pleasure or intiment scent,4
1226,Nice cologne good to wear,5
1226,This is one of the many fragrances i'm going to sick with compliments from the first time I spray it on,5
1226,Hanae-mori him edp. Much love for this beautiful Spice--bomb grown-up scent.,4
1226,"This scent is wonderful. A skin sent after around 5.. but still smells amazing. Would recommend to anyone, with a special someone.",5
1227,First time using this cologne. I like it. A lot.,5
1227,Hugo Boss Just different is a good product.,5
1227,"Hugo Boss ""Just Different"" is just that. It's a nice change from the other fragrance I've be using. I'm 61 and still looking for my scent so I prefer options and this is one that will be on my shelf for years to come.",4
1228,Jaguar Gold. This Golden bottle & delicious liquid reminds me of Dunhills desire only better. Use sparingly a little goes a long way. Confidence will be key; it is sweet smelling but not overtly so. Its like Dunhill but with the volume turned down.,4
1228,If you like cheap a plastic smell then buy Classic Gold!,1
1228,"To me Jaguar Gold is a sweeter musk, very pleasant, many compliments, lasts about 6 hours. A good value cologne.",5
1228,"Jaguar Classic Gold is a sexy beast mode fragrance. It projects like a monster, last all day & I've received many compliments on this juice in the few times I've worn it. Great purchase for the price",4
1228,Awesome I really like it,5
1230,"Smells so fresh and light, moon light by Ariana grande. Glad I ordered it will be getting a couple more bottles.",5
1230,Love the bottle and the fragrance this was a good offer price was right and it was shipped very well.,5
1231," Obsessed by Calvin Klein smells fantastic!! it last forever on me, even when i go to bed the next day still smell strong, love it",5
1231,"I absolutely LOVE OBSESSED parfum. It has a clean, light baby powder scent with other yummy smells. I am always complimented by men and women that I smell good. The only negative is the staying power. I have to reapply. It would get 5 stars otherwise. ",4
1231,"Because I absolutely love Euphoria by Calvin Klein, I thought I'd give this fragrance a try. Soooo disappointed! This has no lasting power...at least for me....and is very expensive for a scent that leaves almost as soon as it's applied. Will stick with my Euphoria - have been asked multiple times what fragrance I'm wearing - lasts all day. ",2
1231,Love it smell too good,4
1232,"I bought this for my husband, because my Dad used it a lot. Like the smell, a bit different from years ago, but still a nice smell.",4
1232,"I bought this because not only do I like the scent, but it reminds me of my dad. Growing up this was one of the aftershaves he wore. Wonderful memories of someone I miss so much.",4
1232,Smells good but not the original 1938 scent. ,4
1232,I use to use it when I was younger but back then the bottle was a lot bigger and now it has gotten smaller but I still love the scent and I give it a 10/10 so put it in a bigger bottle :),5
1232,"for the money , old spice is an original that seams to stay a favorite to many forever.",5
1233,"This was my first PDM scent I purchased and in fact my first niche scent. I origionally was going to purchase Layton ""I did eventually"" however when my fiance smelled this one she demanded that I get this one. It has a lot of milky almond notes in it and is a sweet scent. However it can be used in the warmer months just be careful. It is very long lasting and has great performance. You only really need 2, possibly 3 sprays tops. After that your ""that guy"". Because of the sweetness it can be overpowering at high volume. Great scent and one of my faves to this day even after receiving Layton and Percival as well as a Creed.",5
1233,Honestly one of the best colognes on the market. Parfums de marly have many master pieces and pegasus is one of them! It has a smooth vibe that last forever!,5
1233,"Parfums de Marly Pegasus - I don’t like it. Some describe it as metallic like. I’m not sure what it is but I don’t like it. I’d say it is strong also. What I’ve learned it to not blind buy,but sample every cologne cause a lot of reviews are very misleading and everyone have different senses of smell.",1
1233,Parfums de Marly Pegasus love it very strong last long,5
1233,"Pegasus Parfums de Marly,is this oriental Fougere where I smell Vanilla,almonds,amber,& undertones of sandlewood!!Very nice,suitable for formal black tie events..I get 8-10 hours longevity with moderate projection!!Strictly winter wear!!",5
1234,"Is a very unique scent. Definitely ""announces"" your presence in the room. I truly like it. Bought it as gifts for my girlfriend and daughter. Sweet scent. Good value! I recommend.",5
1234,I love it! Smells so yummy my fiance loves it cause it's sweet smells like cotton candy i love all things sweet,5
1234,A little watery but the scent is perfect lasts all day!,5
1234,"Pink Sugar body lotion is the best. It softens skin so well, plus it doesn't take forever to be absorbed by the skin!! Even on your hands, after rubbing it in, NO SLIPPERY HANDS, JUST SOFT. The fragrance is divine. ",5
1234,"The pink sugar body lotion Is amazing, so creamy, yet so light, and easily absorbed into the skin! I can honestly say being a woman That moisturises everyday! From all Lotions I have tried this is the best! The smell! The feel! How long the fragrance lasts during the day makes this product that even more beautiful! If you love your sweet and feminine scents this is the product to use and trust me you'll be hooked and in love on the first use. So happy with this product definetly worth the price and lotion!",5
1235,I've been wearing skin musk for over 30 years. I always receive compliments.,5
1235,"I first worn Skin Musk oil about 40 years ago and loved the scent, but could not find it in the stores anymore. I happened to find it on this site and this is my second purchase. I always get compliments when I wear it, which I do often!! Although I don't notice the scent after the first few minutes, others do. When I was at Lowes one day shopping, a man came by me and said you are leaving a nice scent trail. It is just a nice subtle scent I love !!",5
1235,"I've been wearing Skin Musk Oil for at least 40 years. But, the oil is much better than the spray. The spray is weak, and the true scent that blends with one's own chemistry isn't as effective. Also, I mix Skin Musk with other colognes/oils, i.e..m, Patchouli oil. It's THE most unique fragrance when blended ",5
1235,I have been wearing Skin Musk for many years and I always get compliments. It’s great to use as base with another scent.,5
1235,"I have been wearing Skin Musk for over 40 yrs. I also have the cologne and the spray. I always get such wonderful compliments from others. I would love the lotion & shower gel as well. I like to layer the fragrance. thanks for keeping the musk oil available. Just wish the others,i.e.lotion,gel would be made and easy to get.",5
1236,Im in love with these perfume. Very recommended!! Its smells sweet but soft!! Perfect for day and night. ,5
1236,Smell very good i purchase to my wife and she love this perfume. ,5
1237,Smells absolutely amazing and I got alot of compliments as well with it ,5
1237,"Kenneth Cole vintage black,is probably my favorite cologne of all time and I probably smelled everything there is to smell, well I like polo red also...",3
1237,cologn is awesome the price even better. its worth the wait. i usually order what i want even if i dont need it.,3
1237,"The scent of Vintage Black is amazing. It is not over powering, but gives just enough to turn heads. the compliments are the best (what do you have on, it smells so good). I do believe this has moved to the top on my cologne list.",5
1237,The scent is subtle and clean. Very refreshing. Great for any time. My husband loved it.,5
1239,"Oh my Creed Royal Mayfair, a little rosey but the dry down is so nice and fresh, a mature persons fragrance ",5
1239,"Creed Royal Mayfair Well packaged and fast delivery. Love this scent, mad that I didn't order a larger size. Frangrancenet is my go to when looking for colognes.",5
1239," Creed's Royal Mayfair is a stunning fragrance! The gin note, pine and eucalyptus mixed with lime and Duke of Windsor rose has this amazing British feel to it. Almost difficult to describe. It's dry with crushed leaves and a hint of burning eucalyptus underneath a gin and tonic with lime English countryside scent. That rose sits in the heart. Where is my horse and carriage? Creed please keep making this gem! Also, FragranceNet is absolutely fantastic! I always get amazing service. Thanks Again!!!",5
1239,"It's original and it stay on body for 6+hrs and on cloths for over 24hrs, smells very nice, you will get compliments but not as potent as Aventus, it's very modern and classy. My review is not bias, it's for real.",5
1239,Wow! Just got my 4oz bottle of Creed Mayfair from FragranceNet and it’s AWESOME!!! For the price and product YOU CANNOT BEAT THEM!!! ,5
1240,I really like both of these perfumes. Nice summer scents. ,5
1241,It’s smell pretty good but not expensive but so much better then the AB splint silver ,3
1241,"Lomani's 'Lomani' for Men smells exactly like Drakkar Noir by Guy Laroche, is super cheap and lasts an incredibly long time and has great performance. This is a 1980's masculine powerhouse fragrance, a true classic. ",5
1241,Lomani smells so good!!! I love when my husband wears this cologne. I plan to purchase several for him as a Christmas gift. To stock him up for a long while.,5
1242,Subtle but elegant fragrance is all I use since it’s creation . I have wonderful compliments every time I wear it. It blends with my chemistry and its fragrance is never over powering. I wish they could bring it back. ,5
1242,"White Diamonds is a mature, sultry scent. It smells expensive and is really long lasting. It isn't something that I particularly like for myself but it seems to be of a good quality. ",4
1242,"White Diamonds eau de parfum BY Elizabeth Taylor, is my all time favorite and I am so glad I found it again. Your service was easy with quick delivery. I had thought I wouldn't find the Parfum again and I am so thankful for keeping the box from fragrance. net so I could get it again. I would like a bigger size, but bought 2 so I will have it for awhile. One spritz in the morning lasts all day. Thank you.",5
1242,I've worn White Diamonds several years and have had numerous compliments on it. Thank you for allowing me to save money by buying through fragrance net. I've recommended to friends and now I'm the hero for sharing your site.,5
1242,"I ordered White Diamond by Liz Taylor perfume. The fragrance is divine and long lasting. Also am trying her perfumed powder. Great for after bathing! Will keep this perfume next to my longtime signature perfume! Ps there is only two, including this one. ",4
1245,"Love bath gel, deodorant and body spray! Very light and airy reminds me outdoors and lots of leaves. I love this fragrance!",5
1245,This is my first purchase of th Green Tea shower gel to enhance the staying power whenever I wear the matching parfum. Love the generous size (16 oz). Great size at a gret price.,5
1245,GREEN TEA IS NOT OVERPOWERING BUT SUBTLE AND JUST BEAUTIFUL....VERY NATURAL PRESENTATION.,5
1245,I have a boyfriend who loves the scent of green tea. Our bathroom always smell great each time we use this shower gel. He finds it very refreshing and gets a good night's sleep from just breathing it under his pajamas. Now that's what I call a guy who appreciates a lady's beauty ritual. ,5
1245,Delicate light flowery pleasant fragrance. I am a medical provider and my patients ALWAYS tell me how good I smell. I have worn this fragrance for probably over 20 years. It works with my body chemistry.,5

1247,"Eau Impériale is an Eau de Cologne and by definition lighter than perfume. I grew up in France and remember these Eaux being popular when I was small. Impériale is light, doesn’t last very long and I see it more as a delightful personal pleasure to enjoy after the shower; it’s like rubbing your hands in a basket of citrus and branches of rosemary. It’s a sensational aromatic and heavenly refreshment that will remain out of time and always trendy.",5
1247,"Imperial Guerlain, delicious in small batches. I still have the old bottle .",5
1247,"Been using Imperiale cologne for 20+ years, bought on Air France flight first time, and loved it. Still do. Green Jeans was it’s only rival by Versace. They quit making it though. Hope to enjoy it far into the future! ",5
1247,"this is one of my favorite fragrances from Guerlain, I also use Vetiver, I have been using it since my Uncle used it in the 60's. If my memory serves me correctly it was designed by Guerlain for Napoleon. Great light citrus classic.",5
1247,"This is a very clean scent perfect for babies to adults, male or female. It does not clash with my L'Heure Bleue for evening, so any tell-tale scent on my skin from either combines perfectly. Lavender cologne splashes also mix well. I have been told I smell ""delicious"".......:) ",5
1248,Spring time in Paris. It smells soft with a spring shower of freshness. Great long wear keeps to shower skin. ,5
1248,"Light & Fresh. Jeanne Lanvin...I love the Peony in this fragrance. It’s light , airy and does not overpower. Last for about 7 hours. I have found a good way to test lasting power of my fragrances by applying them at night after showering and wearing them to bed. This fragrance was still present after 7 hours. ",4
1248,"This scent is simply spectacular!!! I have purchased my 4th bottle of Jeanne Lanvin!! It is soft and very beautiful...it smells fruity at the initial first spray ( top notes ) and as it drys down, it gets better and better and becomes more soft and floral.. I get so many compliments.. I love all of the lanvin fragrances!! Very sophisticated, I also mix this sent with a spray of eclat fleur... another amazing fragrance!! The price point is great too!! ",4
1248,Love this sweet scent. Just got my 2nd bottle and my first wasnt even out. Bf loves it too! Cant get over its scent!,5
1249,I use Karl Largerfeld I wear it to work I get so many compliments and it lasts all day I have a busy physical job and people ask me how I smell so fresh after a shift ,5
1249, KARL LAGERFELD perfume I loved it and received a lot of complements AA,5
1249,"Karl Lagerfield is my favorite perfume, I get so many compliments, everyone always asks what I’m wearing. ",5
1249,Its incredible and amazing,5
1249,I was extremely disappointed in this purchase of Karl Lagerfeld...it smells 'nothing' like the Lagerfeld perfume I remember. It does have a clean scent that is not bad but it only lasts about an hour. Would not recommend this to others.,1
1250,"My All time Favourite on my man!!! Smells confident, warm and delicious. YSL Body Kurous",5
1250,"Kouros Body (dark grey bottle) is the scent I have been searching for: incense, woody, leather. Although very Eastern in scent, it is not overpowering, yet lasts all night long. On some clothing, I can still smell it a couple days later. There is an air of mystery about this cologne and most people comment that it's like nothing they have ever smelled before. I would say it is definitely manly in a sophisticated way. What I particularly appreciate is the lack of overwhelming and generic citrus high notes found in so many other products. I'll be back for more of this. Like most YSL products, the quality is usually exceptional.",5
1250,"Body kouros just got this in the mail, my first purchase off of fragrancenet, everything came perfectly and two days before the estimated date. Came with a sample of another fragrance and nail clippers as well. Anyhow the scent is very great. The incense eucalyptus benzoin etc is delicious. It almost has a new shoe kind of leathery smell to it, but with sweetness almost like manly Cotton candy. And some fresh-ness. very interesting and mellow. Sweet, dark and upfront. This could easily be a signature",5
1251,Jackie I love this product !!!,5
1251,Jackie :Lacoste live!!!!! love this perfum. but want to buy with no adding bag jackie lacost live I recmend it to every sexy men !!! lacoste live love it with good smell!!!!!!!###,5
1251,nice fragrance cant wait to buy ,5
1251,This is definitely one of my favorite colognes to wear. Many people have complimented the smell and it lasts a decent amount of time. It was the cologne I chose on my wedding day too :) ,5
1251,Perfect for any age. Smell sexy and fresh. It's a good cuddling smell.,5
1252,I’m so happy to find my favorite perfume. Not even the stores sell it anymore. Thank you so much,5
1253,"Oldie, but you can count on some compliments when you sport this.",4
1253,Bought this 9IX rocawear for my husband love the scent on him. He is always telling people about it that's how much friends and acquaintances notice ,5
1253,I got this last year as a gift and I loved it.,5
1254,Annuci is a timeless classic. My Fragrance collection was not complete until i added Annuci. A Fresh scent for the ages.,5
1254,"Anucci is a very smooth, clean, light cologne and the sent will stay with you until you was it off. You only have to spray a very small amount on both sides of your neck and you will be smelling very nice all day or night depends when you use it.",5
1254,MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE FOR MY BOYFRIEND HE LOVES IT TO DEATH ,5
1254,ANNUCI I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY BOYFRIEND HE LOVES IT VERY MUCH SO MUCH VERY GOOD COLOGNE FOR MEN ,5
1254,Anucci edt has a very nice smell to it i have only used it once so far and i really like the bottle that's shaped like a golf ball,4
1256,"I came across Hummer because a friend of mine wears it, he could not find it. It's his all time favorite. I love it too. I got it for him, I am so glad I found it. He is very happy.",5
1256,The fragrance notes are so fresh and stays on unlike a lot of other fragrances. It is one of my favourites. highly recommended,5
1256,I just love Hummer cologne I wear it just about everyday... I'm always asked what's the name of the cologne you're wearing.,5
1256,"Hummer is an outstanding fragrance for the guy who wants to smell as good as he looks. You can be confident that when you walk past the ladies they will notice you, Great price for a great fragrance..",5
1257,Mariah Carey Dreams perfume is the Best smelling perfume EVER! Can’t get enough of it!,5
1257,"Dreams by Mariah Carey is a nice light clean scent. I discovered it because it was on clearance and I needed some new perfume, so I gave it a try. I really like it . I have been using it every since. It also comes in a dry oil spray which is really good too! I highly recommend. ",4
1257,"I love this perfume Dream. It is love my favorites. I love almost all her perfumes. If you are interested Luscious pink is nice, the one she has in the crystal looking bottle is wonderful. You can’t go wrong with her perfumes. ",5
1257,"Mariah Carey Dreams perfume is a very nice sweet and subtle smell...not too strong, and not too sweet. It's just perfect for me. I love the fragrance and the packaging...and I will be purchasing this again.",5
1257,I love all her product's!,5
1258,I grew up surrounded by my mother's favorite perfume... Mitsouko was my father's gift to her every Christmas and then mine as well when I reached 20! My mother died in 1984 and I still have her last flacon with a few drops left... I treasure it! It is more of a winter perfume and YES a little bit on the temples and behind the ears really goes a long way. It is a must! My fave at age 75+,5
1258,"Guerlain Mitsouko is a strong fragrance that lasts very well all day. To me it has similarities to Clinique Aromatic Elixir with a kick of spice at the end. It could easily overpower a co-worker, I have to put this on VERY sparingly. If you don’t like a heavy fragrance, you won’t like this, but I love it! Unusual, fresh and spicy all at the same time! Just apply lightly and you’ll be fine. Sarah Simpson, CA",4
1258,"Mitsouko, is One of my favorite perfumes. It is woodsy-floral, and last for a long time. Everytime I wear it, I get many compliments. I hope they never take it off the market! I love it!",5
1258,"I love Mitsouko. I use it since I was on college and now I am 79 years old. It's a ""miracle"" I could keep using it, because everything that is good they take it off from the mark and never again you see it, I don't know why... Thank God they haven't do it with Mitsouko.",5
1258,"Mitsouko, has a wonderful scent, thumbs up",5
1259,The Sample did not satisfy my expectation. I am wondering how I can return it.,1
1259,"i ordered Montale Black Oud for my self and love it , shipping was fast and price was much better then any other place , Highly recommended Brand and place to buy expensive perfumes Thank you ",5
1259,"Montale Paris Black Aoud is elegant, sexy, and masculine all at the same time. You only need to wear a small amount though because it is quite a rich cologne. I would highly recommend this product to any man looking for a subtle, but rich fragrance. It is also great for evening wear and is more of a winter cologne. ",5
1259,Fragrance with her own personality. It’s not for anybody and not for every moment. Black aoud by Montale Paris’s very good,4
1259,"Montale Paris Black Aoud I ordered for my husband and I'm glad he likes that perfume very much. The smell is strong and delicate at the same time, elegant and sexy, interesting and original. ",5
1260,My Burberry Blush is my my all time favorite. ,5
1261,Excellent fragrance!! Would buy over and over!,5
1261,"This fragrance definitely opens a little sharp and within seconds starts rounding out. It’s soft and spicy with cardamom and nutmeg at the top. Soon the cedar, ebony wood and vetiver anchor the fragrance. It’s an elegant fragrance that can be worn all year round. Like this one! When it dries down it becomes ""juicy"". My mouth actually starts watering... totally weird.",4

1261,"I ordered one for my wife, she liked it then I just ordered one for my self. Loving it. ",5
1263,I don’t really like the Pink Sugar Sensual so much it’s to strong and it gave me a headache the first time I sprayed it. I prefer the original Pink Sugar I love it so much. Pink sugar sensual is not my favorite by far.,2
1263,Really like this one but not one I will keep on hand always,3
1263,"Ive worn the orginal Pink Sugar for the longest so i decided to try the Pink Sugar Sensual...ive found my new pink sugar...i prefer this one over the orginally its so sweet,smooth and clean smelling that last for hours.",5
1263,I love this fragrance better than the orginal pink sugar...this PS Sensual is fresh and sweet smelling and it lasts for hours.,5
1263,"Pink Sugar Sensual is nice too, but for me I do prefer the PINK SUGAR. ",5
1264,"I was using this fragrance sometime during 2004 and I used to love it. I just purchased one more from fragrancenet recently and I am glad I did. I just love this cologne. It’s long lasting, very masculine and is distinctly different from the other collections I have. This is one of my best perfumes along with Terre d Hermès, Versace signature, Armani Profumo and Allure, it may sound strange to compare with something expensive as this product is least expensive and simply affordable, but not sure why this cologne did not get the attention it deserved. I just love it very much and I am planning to buy one or two bottle more and stock them to replenish! ",5
1264,"This is a very great cologne every where I go i get compliments I would definitely recommend it to a friend, and you can beat the price",5

1265,My friend has used this for many years . She was thrilled when I picked this up for her. I put a BIG smile on her face today!,5
1265,My mom used to buy Tatiana perfume when I was young. I remember the lovely scent so I stocked up on this bath oil. I sure wish this company would bring this back in perfume form. FYI...this is a great company to purchase products from! ,5
1265,I have extremely dry skin. I decided to try this bath oil as a perfume. It gives off a very soft floral scent that stays with me all day. I love it.,5

1265,"I can’t wait till I have mine in front of me. I’ve used this perfume in high school, and I’ve always loved it. But once liberty house closed down. I had no idea wear I would find it. Thank’s fragrancenet. ",5
1266,"Good size for the price, allowing you to truly test the product and see if it blends well with you. ",4
1266,Loved my Versace Variety!! ❤❤,5
1266,It smell good. Came one day early than the expected date. I like it thanks.,4
1266,Versace variety pack is nice because I can try these fragrances first at a fraction of the cost. I don't have to worry about buyers remorse with a blind buy or wishing I had bought one fragrance over. Plus my wife gets to sample a few perfumes for herself. Samples very small though. Don't think I will go for any .17 ounce samples again. Just too little of a sample to really get a good read with performance.,3
1266,"Good mix of colognes. Recommend to try these, and then pick the best one and buy full-size version.",4
1267,Burberry Summer - I love it! Just the right scent - not to strong not to light. makes me feel very feminine. ,5
1267,Burberry Summer is AMAZING! It’s fresh and feminine. I LOOOOOVE it. I would definitely recommend it. ,5

1267,"I order a lot of perfume, it is my one thing that I enjoy when I complete my full look for the day. It really sets the 'tone' of how I am entering into the day or evenings event. This scent was very much a surprise. I did not think it would be a new summer favorite, but it is and I can not get enough. Rarely do I wear a scent back to back but this is an exception. Perfect for Summers' heat or for any occasion. I highly recommend this one, its' light femininity will have everyone delighted. Especially yourself. ",5
1268,Clean is so fresh and wonderful. ,5
1268,Perfect mix of light and fresh ingredients. Very soft. It's very unfortunate it has been discontinued.,5

1268,Very clean aroma without being overpowering.,5
1269,"I wear this fragrance to work and get so many men asking what I am wearing that I feel like a spokes person for clean shower fresh. I do wear some of the others and mix them together with same results. Clean shower is definately for the senior woman, as all age men seem to follow you to ask, ""You smell so good, what are you wearing and where can you get it?"" Of course I am eager to give them all the information and in a few weeks their wives are truly believers in the CLEAN fragrance. Truly the perfect fragrance for young and old. Cathy from Florida ",5
1269,"1 oz. Clean Shower Fresh: I liked it. It had a little 'bite' to it that I don't know how to describe, because I could not identify the fragrance element, but it was nice, not unpleasant. It kept the fragrance from being blah and boring, because it was supposed to be 'clean'. I sprayed a lot on in the morning in order to be able to smell it throughout the day, and I was able to smell just a subtle bit of it all day long.",3
1269,Decent smell. Clean and fresh. Not as great as other CLEAN fragrances I've used in the past ,4

1270,Love this perfume. It's one of my fave along with the other Malibu. Orange color. You can't smell it on yourself but other people do. That's because it's mild scented and that works for me. Nothing over powering to kicks off my allergies.,5

1275,"Hmm,great scent. A bit strong but it lasts the whole day until night time. In my opinion it smells somewhat like Azzura by Loris Azzaro but without the floral undertones. Since that one's not made anymore,I guess I'll consider fairy dust a nice replacement. ",5

The little fairy logo & bottle design is very cute too.",5

Citrusy, mellow yet almost piney, a bit woody..and the drydown is delicious. Does not project much of course, which makes it great for the gym. It will last a few hrs maybe, after that the remnants will linger on your clothes for a day or so. Great flanker and must have for sporty fragrance/issey fragrance lovers.

You will fall in love with it. ",5
1294,My favorite Shalimar is the Eau de Cologne. I read somewhere that it takes you right where it takes an hour or more for the edp and the edt to get to.

I find myself reaching for it more often than any of my over 100 other scents. ,5

I would like to get the shower gel and the body powder again, then I can do a one stop shop. When I could not find it I did not wear any cologne. This stuff is excellent.",5
1299,I have been using Chloe since the 1978 and constantly have women stop and ask me what am wearing and where can they get it.

1300,"I had received a mini bottle of Curve Connect as a child and had always wondered where I could purchase it. 14 years later (Im 22 now) I found it on this website. The scent is unique all together and I guarantee it won't be one of those colognes people attempt to guess due to similarities with mimicking scents most colognes have these days. They'll want to know what it is and why they never smelled the scent before. The scent is absolutely amazing. It lingered in my mind through childhood years all they way til adulthood. And although it has been 14 years, the scent is still as unique as I remember. You will be satisfied.",5

1302,"Ermenegildo Zegna Acqua Di Bergamotto The bergamot in the top note (which is reportedly grown and harvested on the Zegna estate in Calabria) is a lovely natural-smelling sharp citrus. This fresh, invigorating blast is beautiful but all too fleeting. In the next (and final) phase, a wonderfully pleasing soapy vetiver takes over - soft and creamy, with a barbershop vibe that remains the same for the duration. Sillage is moderate; projection stays fairly close, finally becoming more of a skin scent; and longevity (on me) is about 4 to 5 hours. It is a skillfully blended fragrance, made with very high quality, natural ingredients – a calming scent that would make a refined and sophisticated choice to wear for dressier outings in the heat of summer.",4
1302,ermenegildo-zegna-acqua-di-bergamotto/edt Is a sophisticated and clean scent that's good to sport day or night.,5

This is a floral fragrance, and I can definitely smell honeysuckle more than anything, (or something that reminds me of honeysuckles). :) It's very fresh to me, not overpowering, and very nice. Even after it's been on my skin for awhile, it still smells fresh to me. It didn't turn into anything different that I don't like (like musk). I could smell this all day and I didn't think there was a need to reapply at all.",5
1303,I love the smell. It’s long lasting and fresh. ,5

1312,"I just bought Carolina Herrera Chic and my first impression of it at first was “oh wow this smells very good sexy in a way""CHIC is light but also intriguing it has that mysterious type of scent that u only get in older type of colognes from the older days which I love cuz they weren't synthetic like now. I definitely found a hidden gem on this buy guys please get this one by Carolina Herrera, sexy light and makes people say “wow that smells amazing what are you wearing""!?! ",5
1312,"As Herrera is my favorite fragrance line, CHIC is in my top 5 (of Herrera scents) easily. It is a strong scent that goes a long way. One spray on the pulse points is all you need and you will still be able to smell it later in the day as it tapers down a bit. Definitely a manly scent, mostly will wear at night or for church, but doesn't hurt in the daytime in fall or winter. ",4
1313,Great scent reminds me Tom Ford tobacco vanilla and Chergei. Sweet but mildly spicey. Elegant and sophisticated.,5
1313,Guerlain L’homme ideal was not as masculine as I wanted or expected. It’s a beautiful fragrance and is not suitable for winter. It’s light freshness is appealing and it kept working all day. It’s now autumn here so I will put it aside for spring.,4

1313,L'Homme Ideal Eau de Toilette,2
1313,"Luxurious and beautiful fragrance describing strong, masculine and handsome man",5
1314,"Like all of my Guerlain fragrances, wait for the dry down. It takes a while to get there, but it’s worth the wait. It’s old. It’s new. It’s special. The fragrance is multi faceted; the floral aspect is balanced by the wood elements, so it never becomes sweet. The dry down is heavenly as the Vanilla mixed with the Rose, woods, Patchouli & leather orchestration renders that unmistakable aura of sophistication and elegance. This is a must-have in the scent wardrobe of men 40+. Guerlain is one of my favorite houses.",5
1314,"Habit Rouge EDP is THE scent of my man, I literally lie on his chest sniffing him and the Habit Rouge. It holds a long time and is sensual and earthy. Mature, tasteful men go well with this EDP, so if you have one, then get him into the Habit Rouge habit.",5
1314,Habit Rouge Eau de Parfume. I have both the Eau de Tiolette and Parfume. I find the Toilette to be more fragrant and longer lasting. I have enjoyed Habit Rouge for years and enjoy it more now with your friendly pricing. I will be going back to the Eau de Toilette. Al Metzger,3
1314,Habit Rouge by Guerlain is a Classic since 1965. I discovered it in 1999 and have been wearing it ever since. I love how it makes me in the morning. ,5

Otherwise everyone would buy it and I like being the guy that gets noticed because I smell great. But... $25 for a stick of deodorant? Not happening here. Sorry guys, it mast smell great but it's just deodorant. ",5
1323,My husband loves the Aramis deodorant ,5

1329,My favourite parfum. I like the strong woody smell.,5
1329,"Nuit D'Issey Parfum is a very intriguing, masculine scent. Being a parfum, this is very well blended and refined on initial blast, and does not overwhelm your senses by feeling heavy. It smells great in my opinion, in the same realm as Armani Code; leathery, citrusy, smooth. The sillage is moderate for a parfum, longevity is around 6-8 hours on my skin (skin scent after 90 minutes or so). It is more refined and less harsh than the EDT. This is an authentic product. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who is knew to fragrance and is just looking for something to start out with. With more experience, one would most likely appreciate this parfum more. ",5
1329,Very good product. It last long. ,5

I am on 8 hours + and the fragrance still smells the same from the day I bought it. I was very surprised. If the fragrance dies before 8 hours then you received a knock-off, this fragrance was always moderate and long lasting . . . from day one and now 21 years later. ",5

I searched the description before buying and it was very appealing to me . Now that I have it, it's something I have been looking for for such a long time. Sexy, feminine, have received so many compliments. I am getting another bottle right after I finish this review. Would recommend it if you want to feel truly feminine .

It is very classy, confident and long lasting. I have 20 or so bottles of cologne. This is my new go to. It is different than the rest. First time I wore it was too a ugly sweater Christmas party. Not only was I getting a ton of compliments by both guys and girls but it was the compliments themselves that stood out. I was told I smell absolutely delicious. Guys were telling me if I was a girl they would try and take me home. And I think 2 or 3 girls told me that they would could just eat me all up. Then I wore it to work 1 day and everybody kept lingering around in my office which was a little strange. If you don't like or want attention then DON'T buy Habit Rogue. If you do like attention buy it for Pete's sake!!! Good stuff!!!",5
1356,I want buy this product today !!! Jackie,5
1356,Habit Rouge by Guerlain is a great Eau de Toilette. It's an acquired taste. The only people who have complimented me when I wear this are people in their 40's and older. My little sisters think it's a grandpa's cologne and the women I have dated told me they didn't like it. I'm 30 y.o. as of 03/07/2018 and started wearing that when I turned 28. Not for everyone.,5

1361,"Another update: 2 years and I...unfaithful to every other perfume I have tried (and I have tried DOZENS!)...I am STILL wearing L'Autre Oud, exclusively. TRY THIS PERFUME!!!",5
1361,"This is an update: I just gave away the last bottle of my collection of lovely perfumes, because I have found my signature scent. It is L'Autre Oud forever, now! Um..I blush to say the first review is mine as well and the spice is SAFFRON, not cinnamon! The incense in this fabulous scent is dark and smoky and intimate, but the rose lightens the overall effect. Imagine a glorious bazaar at the edge of a desert, just as the heat of the day turns to night. A caravan of spices and incense has laid out its wears for the next market and you wander through alone, in the darkness, with only the light of a few distant fires to let you see what you sample. You drop this parfum on your shawl and pull it around you: warmth, smoke, dizzying incense, a top note of roses at full blush of noon. THAT is the smell. Incomparable! And eternally intoxicating. I am hooked! ",5
1361,"L'Autre Oud may well be my new favorite scent. Known as a ""floriental"", the scent has top note of citrus, heart of rose, and frankincense and cinnamon as the lasting dry down. I sprayed it on and went to heaven. This is a perfume you MUST smell to believe. The combination is masterly and it works well for strong, independent women as for men. I cannot BELIEVE that cinnamon goes with rose. But it does! I recommend it highly. Thanks FrangranceNetcom!",5
1362,"Making a fragrance decision is very personal. My favorite Marc Jacobs because I love the scent of gardenias as it is fresh & lingers! I have been complimented often wearing the eau de parfum because it lasts and absorbs nicely throughout the day! Fresh & clean, I love this product! There is a reason it is SOLD out! Bring it back!",5

1362,It is one of the best fragrances...its very light but lingers with a soft feminine scent. It is very hard to find... since it is I do believe his 1st scent. It is also pricy.... but worth every dime! ,5

1365,"Smells like Guerlain's vetiver. Reminds me of church incense. Not a sexy scent per se but a clean, strong, pungent scent that projects. Like woodsy fresh cut grass. A nice scent, think: older gentlemen, not young going out clubbing. Day event, wedding, baptism, going golfing type of fragrance for me.",4

1369,"IThank you for the opportunity to give my review. Unfortunately, I did not like the smell of this perfume. I have purchased “Clean” by Cashmere in the past and it is a total different smell. I actually had some and compared the smell and the totally different. Thank you Teresa",1
1369,This is an excellent frangrance for my body chemistry. It smells like I just stepped out of the shower all day. I get constant compliments from men and women. I highly recommend. ,1
1369,I got Clean as a sample with Birchbok and It has been my favorite ever since! And I have used many different kinds of expensive cologne ,1
1369,CLEAN is my favorite because t reminds me of that totally clean smell. It is so pleasant and fresh.,5
1370,"Diorissimo is my signature Parfum, since 1990... Everyone knows when the aroma of lillies of the valley fills the air that I am near by...",5
1370,Diorissimo is The best fragrance ever. Great price.,5
1370,"I have worn DIORISSIMMO since 1955 happily! It wraps me like the lovliest cloak of gorgeous scents of lily of the valley, lilac and hyacinth with wisps of jasmine and lilies. It's a magnificent work of art. My friends all love to get my clothes as they are infused forever with this wonder!",5
1370,"I first discovered Diorissimo in my 20s, when I was looking for a special fragrance for my wedding day. What drew me to it was the truest lily of the valley scent I had ever smelled, with white flowers and such freshness that it became a fragrance one could wear any time of day and have it be perfect. Clean, yet crisp and soft all at the same time, and truly elegant. As the years past, I could no longer find it, and this was before the days of the internet and online shopping! I moved on to other fragrances, but alas, never did find anything that compared to it. Until now! So, after 22 years since I wore the original, I am ordering this for myself! I am sure my teenage daughters are going to want to borrow this one from me! ",5

1371,One of my favorite colognes. I haven't been able to find it for years.,5
1371,"This scent smells about 85%-90% exactly like Zest deodorant bar soap. It's a bit sharp at first spray, but it dries down well and continues to smell like bar soap. It's a nice, clean, safe scent to wear anytime. It's sillage may not work outside in the winter time though, it's overall a clean, lighter scent. Scent:6.5 Longevity:4 Sillage/Projection:5 Unique/Industry First:6 Quality:5",4
1371,This perfume has a nice powdery scent with a hint of woods. Unfortunately after a couple hours it faded for me. Also I hated the outer case so I popped it off! I love this website because you can try a variety of scents without spending a lot of cash!,4

1372, Never tried this before but glad I bought it. It smells amazing & lasts all day. Love 100% authentic & price was outstanding. I work for a major retailer & the price was better than my discount. ,5
1372,"Gucci Flora It's perfect. I forget I have it on but am reminded by men and women alike: ""you smell great! What IS that you're wearing?"" Love that!!",5

1374,"I was so happy to find Oscar on your website. I had worn it for several years, but eventually had to switch to something less expensive. I think I paid about triple your price for it in exclusive stores. Now that I've found your website, I will be ordering it regularly. Thank you so much for offering the BEST scents at a price that we call all afford!",5
1374,"Oscar is my favorite. I've have worn other lotion and perfumes but, always go back to Oscar. I've been wearing Oscar about 35 years now. It smells clean, not to strong and very sexy. My husband loves it!!! I would recommend everybody try it at least once. You will love it too.",5

Sprayed it at 2 pm, could still smell it at 1 am, and it was almost as strong as when I first put it on. The scent sample in magazines is just a tease. Perfume is much better. I Highly recommended this for perfumistas!",5

1378,"I have been wearing RUMBA since the 80's. It is indeed one of my favorite fragrances and always will be. It is a classic perfume that is always complimented and appreciated. It says that RUMBA is an Eau de Toilette, but don't let that fool you. It is, in many ways, more of a perfume because it lasts. It is unique, fresh, incensey and unforgettable. The day I found RUMBA, I got off the train at Grand Central Station in Manhattan and walked out onto the busy New York City streets smelling hot pretzels, hot dogs, coffee and fumes from the taxi cabs. I walked excitedly up three blocks to Perfumania where I had been introduced to many great fragrances. I could spend hours in that store and always walked out with two bags full of my favorite perfumes. So, if you ask me how I feel about RUMBA....I love it. Once I have it on for an hour or two, it smells like the finest exotic perfume and incense. I get compliments for RUMBA wherever I go, especially from nice gentlemen. ",5
1378,I have being using rumba for over 30yrs and its is still working for me everywhere i go it turns heads i love it has turn a lot of my family and friends on to it in the ,5
1378,"Personally, I love this perfume (Rumba) because is smell very good and it is not offend aroma. I totally recommend it to all the ladies. ",5
1378,This perfume has a wonderful scent and lasts so long! It has a classy scent and yes...men love it:),5
1378,"A friend who works in cosmetics recommended this perfume to me & I was stunned at how beautiful it smelled. I was really looking for something to wear to a wedding as well as an upcoming Christmas party,and THIS... is perfect. I love the simple yet elegant bottle design. Can't wait to get my Rumba on.",5
1379,"I bought this on a blind buy and I couldn't be more pleased with this scent. It has a citrus opening that is gentle enough for me not to get sick and the dry down is even better softer delicate , roses but somehow the citrus is there but not as obvious,This perfume is more springtime than anything but it's still a beautiful ,feminine scent.",5
1379,I love this scent! I get compliments every time I wear it. I always have a spare in my drawer because I don't want to run out!,5
1379,Rumeur to rose is all I wear now every day ever since I started using it! I love love love this fragrance! I will never get tired of wearing it and I do every working day. It is by far my favorite perfume. Thank you :)),5
1379,"I love, love this fragrance. I stumbled across it at a chain department store. I had never heard of it before then. It was rather inexpensive and I figured if I didn't like it I would gift it to my niece or someone. To my surprise it smelled wonderful...a combination of lavender - bergamot - amber - patchouli - spices - vanilla. A soft silky fresh powder sent that lasts throughout the day. I get loads of compliments when I wear it.",5
1379,"I love the fresh clean scent of this perfume. It was given to me as a gift, and I have been wearing it ever since. It makes me feel clean, free, and happy! I would recommend it to anyone.",5
1380,"I made this purchase of Tom Ford's Orchid Soleil on a whim, having not smelled it before I bought it. I was just curious from the description. I'm very glad I did. I truthfully can't identify any of the notes listed. I'd just call it a light floral, It's great to finally have a scent, that when I go out with my husband, he doesn't open all the car windows!",5
1380,"With Tom Ford, you can’t really go wrong but I was just slightly disappointed with this one. I bought it on a whim. It doesn’t last more than a couple hours on my skin but others may have different results. The scent itself was ok. We all know that the Tom Ford brand is pretty spendy and I wish I’d have spent my money one I already knew I loved. With that being said, there probably isn’t a Tom Ford scent in existence that deserves a 1 star. I think this is at least a healthy 3 star. ",3
1380,This my second bottle Love that it last hours,5
1380,"Seriously the best perfume I have ever used. Not everyone would like the initial note but once it settles down, it dries down to a lovely gourmand, creamy, addictive scent. I always get compliments from this. I have tried to appreciate the other Tom Ford scents but this one is the most feminine one without trying to smell like your traditional perfume. My fragrance types are usually fresh, clean, out-of shower scents to powdery and on the other end would be gourmand, creamy, and vanilla scents but only want this as a skin scent and not an overpowering one. Orchid Soleil really has those characteristics for me.",5
1380,"The Tom Ford Orchid Soleil is not a perfume that I would purchase again. The scent is too light for me, too much of a floral scent and it does not last long on my skin. I have Tom Ford Noir and Tom Ford Black Orchid, which are two of my favorites. I prefer a light, musky, non-floral perfume that smells 'warm'. I also didn't like Tom Ford Shanghai Lily and White Suede. I love Valentino and Black Opium....... ",1
1381,"the best smelling perfum thus far, I discovered on an Italian man in a bar in Laguna Beach.. and I am a woman and fell in love with the scent. Been waring this for the last decade...it is divine. ",5
1381,Love it clean fresh I’m in love with Un Jarfin En Mediterránee!!! ,5
1381,"Hermès Un Jardin Mediterranee is a beautiful scent that is not available anywhere near me, so I was very happy to find it here. The price was great and my order arrived two days ahead of schedule. Very happy with my purchase. Will order the matching shower gel and body lotion when they become available. ",5
1381,The best love it,5
1381,This is a classic fragrance I could wear every day. I love it! ,5
1382,My daughter in law purchased this in a big store and gave it to me for my birthday a few years ago. I ran out and saw this on your website so I decided to purchase. I was pleasantly surprised that it is the same scent and will definitely purchase this products in the future. ,5
1382,"I get so many compliments when I'm wearing Vera Wang I hate being out of it, it's mild yet wonderfully fragrant ",5

1385,I have been using angel for years and people compliment me all the time is a graat fragrance almost as good as my channel mademoselle,5
1385,"Angel perfuming body oil, is a fantastic body oil. It has a lighter scent of the perfume, but has that special additive; that makes it become more fragrant, as your body temperature rises / heats up. It also absorbs quickly, as a dry oil would. Not greasy. Plastic bottle is a save. It's great for layering with other angel products. I follow it with the Angel celestial perfuming body cream, then the perfumed dusting powder. Love the blue sheen! I get alot of compliments from both men and women. It's fantastic. Great for when there's a quick run to the store or errands. Try and enjoy! You won't regret it!",5
1386,Hunter by Armaf left me feeling like I got bamboozled. It does nothing for me after I have applied it liberally to my neck and wrists but cant seem to catch then sent. I heldmy wrist up to my nose and my girlfriend nose 30 min after applying it but the nothing performance is a 1 all around. I'm glad I didn't pay much for this bottle.,1

1387,I took a chance and bought this perfume because I liked the notes and was eager to see why a $740 Edp will be on clearance for 22.04. I’m absolutely impressed with the fragrance and longevity. I have ordered almost 20 fragrances from this company this summer and will buy more for the ladies in my family. The prices are great. Azzaro pour femme extreme smells very classy and chic. I’m a happy camper. ,5
1388,"I purchased a few of the Bond No. 9 vials to see which smell I liked and went with my body chemistry. I purchased about 6 different ones. This one by far was the best smelling perfume EVER!!! The two reviews helped my decision to try this one and I am glad I did.. Nice, sweet, fresh smell and long lasting... Right now, I cannot purchase it.. never paid more than 30.00 for perfume, but i'll probably get this for me for my birthday or when I work some OT and have an extra 100.00 to spare.. lol.. S/N: for the other vials I purchased, my personal opinion, ANY unisex perfume is NOT for women!!! :-)",5
1388,This smells absolutely delicious...very fragrant but not over-powering and it's long-lasting!!! ,5
1388,"Hello I thought I would give a review on Madison Ave Bond No 9 since its doesn't have any .. I first smelled a women that was a pizza bar having a drink she past by me has I waited for my pizza carry out , it smelled so BREATH taking I had to ask what was the name of the scent she was wearing and she told me Bond No. 9 Madison Ave. It had a rich lingering scent and I had to track it down, so I found it at the orginal high in store and it costly so I stumbled up on it at Frangance .net still couldn't afford it I tried other lines with samples Madison didn't have samples , at the time now they do and I ordered me one yo make sure it was the same and it was.

Even though it is very intense when you first spray it, it calms down within a minute. The smell is so beautiful, feminine, and sensual. Not overly floral or overly sweet, very balanced. It has a very warm and inviting undertone to it. This is my favorite perfume that I have ever tried. I sprayed a tiny bit on my wrist and the scent was still there 6 hours later. I keep smelling my wrist just to get a wiff of the heavenly scent! I imagine it lasts so much longer on clothes too! There is an ingredient that comes out when you first spray the perfume that is very strong, i think it is bergamot? It smells like ""grandma perfume"" for just a few seconds, then completely disappears into a beautiful sweet, floral concoction! Ce parfum est vraiment belle :)",5

1441,Love the Ivanka Trump for women and the Empire by Trump for men. I also gave them for gifts and the recipients loved them also.,5
1442,Just received Alfred Dunhill Edition that I ordered and was happyli surprised to have been given the gift set with 3 products instead. This eau de toilette smells amazing ,5
1442,"I've been wearing Dunhill Edition since the mid '80s. I bought at the local Dunhill store in Dallas until it closed in the late '90s. I ordered from the Houston store until it was discontinued. Would occasionally find new old stock online but it was going for nearly $100 for the 3.4 oz. spray bottle. Yikes! Really love the reformulation, but it is lite on the citrus notes. I like this one because it doesn't announce your presence when you walk in a room. But, get close and it is a real charmer!",5
1442,"Dunhill Edition edt, by Alfred Dunhill..... really straight spicy, light floral, tons of sandalwood, cinnamon, hinges of ginger and lemon in the dry down: just an incredible smelling fragrance even if I prefere the original one than the reformulation. Gorgeous product! Written by Claudio Tanda on September 03, 2018",5
1442,"This masterpiece ( IMHO), I don’t get citrusy, but straight spicy, light floral, and tons of sandalwood, cinnamon, with hinges of ginger and lemon in the dry down. Just an incredible smelling fragrance even in the reformulation. I will say that the original I purchased back about 15 years ago was filled with fresh and citrusy notes. But this gem here is a bit different and right up the alley of a Dunhillesque fragrance. Either way ( original or reformulation), this smells fantastic! You will receive tons of compliments and with a sophisticated touch of gentlemanly class. ",5
1442,"I was introduced to Dunhill's Edition as a teenager in High School here in the U.S. in the mid to late 80's. My father was working overseas and picked up a bottle while in London. Until then, I had never heard of it as back in the day, everyone I knew was wearing Calvin Klein's Obsession. My dad left it behind when he went back on the road and it found it's way onto my dresser! LOL! All the chic's loved it, and I was so disappointed when it was discontinued! Now that I have found it again, I'm stocking up!!",5
1443,"Delicious perfume. Love Van Cleef & Arpels and this one doesnt disappoint either. Feminine, sexy, and fresh enough to wear both day and night.",5
1443,"If you like Paradise by Alfred Sung, you're most likely going to love Feerie Rubis by VC&A! They smell almost identical! I love them both (but I can't seem to find Paradise by Alfred Sung anymore).",5
1443,Actually bought this fragrance because I liked the bottle(I collect them). I was VERY pleasantly surprised! This is a fantastic fragrance that lasts all day on me. I will DEFINITELY buy it again and I have ordered the blue bottle as well.,5
1443,"I bought Feerie in the blue bottle and loved it! So I decided to try this fragrance as well. I think it's sexy and rich, pretty and floral. A little heavy so you have to be 'that' girl to pull it off. Not for the faint at heart. I love this one as well. ",5
1443,"Feerie Rubis is just not for me. I love the original Feerie in the blue bottle. But this one was just really powdery and too much musky, pink pepper and berries for me. I do get a little peony in it too but the overall impression for me was too powdery. It's a light scent that doesn't last very long on me (maybe 3-4 hours).",2
1444,I've been wearing Gieffeffe by Gianfranco Ferre for many many years and always got complimented on it. When are u going to go back to the larger bottles???,5
1444,Been wearing Gieffeffe by Gianfranco Ferre for many years and ALWAYS receive compliments and have men and women asking what I am wearing and where to buy it. Love this fragrance!,5
1444,"I've been wearing this perfume for YEARS! People always say, is that you I smell?? You smell DELIGHTFUL! I will keep this perfume as a part of. My collection for as long as they sell it!!!!!!",5
1444,I have worn this fragrance for more than 20 years and receive unsolicited compliments with uncanny regularity. It is subtle...definitely NOT flowery...refreshing!,5
1444,PLEASE HAVE BIGGER SIZE OF GIANFRANCO FERRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you!,5
1445,Guess Dare is a very sexy smelling perfume I love it I ordered 2 at 1 time and will be ordering more for gifts please try it if you haven't guarantee you won't regret it,5
1445,"Guess Dare is a very fresh perfume but it's also beautiful, it reminds me of when I picked peaches in Modesto, it is an aroma that leaves an enchanting feel. One can take a walk in the beach and the natural notes of fruit embraces you, The strength is just perfect you can also wear it to work and it will not be too much. ",4

1448,Was given Insurrection II Wild as a gift and I absolutely love it. It is very unique and exotic smelling. ,5
1449,"meh. This fragrance is pleasant. It's a crowd pleaser, but nothing special. It smells like any other perfume you would pick up in Sephora. Nothing about it stands out. It smells very sweet. Very sweet. Floral and a little like honeyed citrus. It's inexpensive on this site so it's worth a try, but you could also buy a Paris Hilton or Britney Spears scent for the same experience.",3

1450,I have been wearing Madame Rochas since 1965. I still have people coming up to me to ask what fragrance I am wearing. I have not used any other fragrance since 1965.

1451,"Maja eau de parfum smells like heaven. Love, love, love it. Can I give it 10 stars?",5
1451,"Maja Eau De Toilette - received a couple of days ago and am disappointed. I have enjoyed the soap for many years and sent it as gifts, but the Eau De Toilette (spray) is so weak, the aroma so faint, that it is like water. I reapplied a couple of times but still required near-nose-proximity to detect. Husband and friend agree. Would return it for refund if I could!",1
1451,Maja I just love it's been around for years I love it,5

1457,"I love the scent of Serge Lutens In Bois Vanille. It smells sweet, warm and of course like vanilla with a hint of sandalwood. I bought a sample and then bought a full bottle. I like to layer this with other vanilla or spicy perfumes that are in my collection, example with Spicebomb. FragranceNet had the best price. The packages were well packed and secure. I will continue to buy from this site. Thanks FragranceNet!",5
1457,"Serge Lutens un bois vanilla I have used this product since it came out and its the only perfume I will use not to strong get complements on this scent all the time I just had a hard time finding it in Canada. I do not like ordering stuff on line if I can find a store in town I would be buying it from them, if not I guess I will have to order on line, because I do love the scent. ",5
1457,Serge Lutens un bois vanille- sweet and woody sent that last all day. Very mature vanilla fragrance. ,4
1457,"Nice, rich vanilla scent with notes of burnt sugar (and some amber that quickly disappears). I wear it everywhere when the weather is cool, but others might find it a bit too strong and sweet and prefer to wear it for special occasions.",5
1457,"beautiful vanilla scent, undertone of a woodsy smell- but it is in no way dominant over the vanilla. ",5
1458,I have never tried Thalliom Black ... but I was greatly pleased and happy with the calm but bold scent and lasting aroma...,4

1462,In the late 1990's my daughter spent her summer vacation in Paris taking classes and becoming more fluent in French. She went into Hermes shop and decided that 24 Faubourg was the scent for me. She was right. I have worn nothing else since I first tried that wonderful gift well over 20 years ago! ,5

1463,"Acqua Essenziale Blu was introduced to me by my son 4years ago and has remained my primary fragrance for work. It lasts all my 12 hours shift and blends very well with my body chemistry. I have had female workers asked me several times for the name of the fragrance many complimenting me for its beauty. I think everyone is entitled to his or her opinion on this product, but I can safely say it has worked very well for me.",5
1463,"Acqua Essenziale Blu, this was a blind purchased. Just wanted something clean for work. The scent is very weak. Smells more like cleaning alcohol. Gives my wife a headache. I have purchased from this site many times. This is the first time I started to feel that this item may not be genuine. ",1

1465,"I purchased Bora Bora Exotic and just received my fragrance yesterday. Bora Bora in my estimation is one of the most beautiful places on earth. The ocean is so blue there that irmt appears purple and the ocean is full of beautiful tropical fish. I first ate a tree ripened lime and grapefruit in Bora Bora and the taste was magnificent, unlike buying those fruits from a grocery store. The Polynesian people that inhabit Bora Bora some of the most friendly in the world. My late husband, Joe took me to French Polynesia and Hawaii for our 25 th wedding anniversary. If the fragrance is as beautiful as the island, I will desire an unending supply.",5
1465,Absolutely love the fragrance ,5
1465,I normally do not like the lighter scents but I love the Bora Bora Exotic. Awesome.,5
1466,"Hugo Boss #6 is still my favorite, it’s the first time I used deodorant spray, thanks for the service!!!",5
1467,Bill Liggon boss orange is better in cooler weather. It is such a wonderful warm scent. It’s has great longevity and sillage is above average. I will always have a bottle,5
1467, This Smells really good,5
1467,I wear this cologne for everything and always get complimented on it. Everyone know when I am in the vicinity because they smell me before they see me. It makes me feel good. Even stronger and more vibrant in the heat. I can still smell it on myself 2 days later. I 100% recommend it and this website. I have bought this product in stores before and here online and here online is just as good quality only cheaper.,5
1467,"I just start to use, like to much",5
1468,"Bought a sample. I actually like this one much better than the original, it is clean, fresh, and citrusy. I think it would be nice for the summer heat, maybe even the gym without being too annoying.",4
1468,"Chrome Sport, also bday present for my son. Loves Chrome, likes sporty scents. No brainer as Chrome a favorite.",5
1468,troly refreshing scent as is other azzaro products have not tried 1 unlikable great value.,5
1468,"Chrome Sport is proven to be not only my husband's cologne of choice these days, but my choice for him as well. Excellent fragrance for any occasion, especially evening events. This fragrance seemingly change to accommodate the occasion. Will definitely put on our top three list and be consistent customers!",5
1468,"Az chrome sport spray ; Young, refreshing and light fragrance. Good for work and play; for any age. I like it.",5
1469,Chrome Summer is wonderful my husband really likes it. I also love the way it smells its definitely a catchy cologne and it's long lasting. He is really a fan of Chrome products by Azzaro.,5
1469,I received my order and I very pleased. I think summer chrome has a very nice scent and it's not over powering but subtle. I give it 5 ,5
1469,Outstanding cologne to wear on an romantic evening,5
1469,"I've been wearing Chrome Azzaro for many years. I tried Chrome Summer and ""wow"". Not only did heads turned as I walked by, but had several ladies stop me and ask what type of cologne I was wearing. In my office, ladies come in all the times, just to get a ""whiff"" of this cologne. Blows my mind and I'm now hooked!!",5
1469,Great for anytime of the day and night. I have many people stop and ask me what I'm wearing while at work or in public. One coworker bought it for her boyfriend and he was hooked. I recommend this cologne to anyone.,5
1470,A great cologne in the original Curve family...you can't go wrong with this clean and refreshing smell. A great smelling cologne that won't disappoint.,5
1470,"This cologne is a definite classic alongside the regular Curve cologne. This smell, however, is more of a crisp and clean type scent compared to the regular Curve scent, which is a slightly spicier scent, but not by much. Both, to me, are easily categorized as clean, subtle fragrances. Curve Sport is a great cologne if you like the clean fresh out of the shower type scent. Great for day to day wear or a night out. Perfect for any occasion. I don't wear colognes that are seasonal. I wear colognes that can be worn everyday for any occasion and this is one of them. ",5
1471,Gucci Guilty is the best perfume by far. Great prices that they have on here for their perfumes and Colognes also. Have bought from them many times and always very satisfied. ,5
1472,"I get many compliments when I wear this one. Not only is a great option for a sexier summer fragrance, it also differs quite a bit from the typical evening fragrance. Love it!",5
1472,"I bought Jennifer Aniston Near Dusk without smelling it first, and it was a risk that paid off. It's a light, sensual scent. Very feminine. Does not smell cheap or like alcohol. Doesn't get stuck in your nose like some perfumes. If there is any negative, I will say that I wish it had longer staying power-but with prices like this, I can afford to re-spray during the day if I need to. I will definitely re-stock when I run out. ",5
1472,I love this fregrance. I get many inquiries of what it's call and where I got it.,5
1472,"Scent is mature, very soft and not overpowering. Good gift idea for a friend.",4
1473,"I wanted to branch out and try the different Juicy Couture fragrances and purchased Hollywood Royal. Did not like it, in fact I sprayed it on before work and buy the time I arrived at work I could not smell it at all. Viva La Juicy Soiree is my favorite and brings loads of compliments. Hollywood is a bust, wish I could send it back and exchange it.",2
1473,Juicy couture Is my best friend signature scent I’ve been low-key wanting it for years just never got around to getting it signed on here for a great price and couldn’t resist I absolutely love it smells great and lasts all day and night even after I showered that night I could still smell the next morning highly recommended!,5
1473,Juicy Couture Hollywood Royal smelled so great when I tested that I immediately took it to the counter and made purchase. Often I need to try a scent several times before buying it. This is a fave! ,5
1473,The most amazing scent. Men absolutely love this fragrance. This is a must buy.,5
1473,"Loved it, ♥ Bought from Khols, but it was beautiful. It probably lasts longer when your not surrounded by 50 different scents at once at the perfume counter. But is just like viva la juicy and viva la juicy noir put together, in the beginning, for about 5 to 10 minutes, then goes to the base where it dries down to a pretty soft viva la juicy and marshmallow soft appealing scent. It is a eau de toilette so its not as strong as eau de parfum. :-( ( I soooooo wish this was a eau de parfum. ) But I love ♥ this scent anyway. Not offensive at all! And my experience is Men Lovvvvvvve ♥ the viva la juicy line. It's great and I don't get migranes and I feel soooo feminine. Will purchase again when I run out. ♥",4
1474,this scent is not the one i was think would be had this kind years back now 2019 order one i am not happy with the smell from this product now .. is my view it dizzy me the smell is strong spice musk for some guy is normal this is to musky and go away fast is my view.,3
1474,L'EAU D'Issey Fraiche is awesome complements the very first day...,5
1475,My girl doesn't like the smell but I do. So I guess I'll wear it when she's not around lol. The performance is good nice clean scent. ,5
1476,Beautiful scent. Wifey loves it and so do I.,5
1476,I have ordered Missoni several times for the past 9 years. I always get compliments. The fragerance is so fresh and clean. I love it and continue to order it. Highly recommend it!,5

1476,"Missoni,it is the first time I have tried this fragrance and so far I do like it.",4
1477,A wonderful professional peppermint essence. Smells very expensive and is non offensive. ,5
1477,Best one they make. My favorite peppermint enhanced spicy cologne. Very professional and sophisticated. Hope it gains momentum and sticks around!,5
1478,Perry Ellis New. In love with this sexy smelling perfume this is a new product for me and oh boy do I like it. It has that want to feel good in your own skin smell. SOUNDS CRAZY but just put it on your pillow and enjoy your dreams.,5

1478,"This is my first time trying the new Perry Ellis and at first I did not like it because it goes on so strong, but the good news is that it tones down to a light pleasant smell. Now I really enjoy it!",4
1479,I like the Ulysses fragrant. That is the reason why I buy it all the time.,5
1479,Great for everyday. Very refreshing scent. Most people love it. I have used it for years now. It is the perfect cologne for everyday use.,5
1479,"Ulysse by Vicky Teal Pefect cologne for anyone that likes the subttle clean scent. the scent is noticeable but light. Great for any occasion, daytime. Office, weekend. ",5
1479,"This is a very soft fragrance. It doesn't shock you. It's not pungent. It is masculine, no doubt. I wouldn't wear with a tuxedo, but would wear to meet a few friends at the local pub! JF",5
1480,"I felt the scent was too light, I couldn't smell it at all, I purchase the metal, red, blue, and black and they all smell the same too light. Great price but was not worth the purchase.",1
1480,"Great smell! Tried it and actually was a very good choice. I have many other colognes costing much higher, but for this price and volume 3.5 oz., I will try all the scents made by this brand. Was definitely a good purchase.",1
1482,it smells really good but doesn't last very long I'm waiting for my other Bond to arrive now. But overall Ok... ,3

1483,"Clean Men, by Clean, lives up, to the product description. The scent is very Refreshing and Vibrant, without losing any sign, of Masculinity. I highly, recommend, Clean Men, by Clean. ",5
1483,"This is my second bottle of Clean Men cologne. Im a guy that likes to smell clean and feel fresh. There is no other cologne on the market that smells like this. It does remind me of a fantastic soapy fragrence, and what's wrong with that. Just like stepping out of the shower, very nice. My wife commented the other night, that I smelled so clean after putting it on. I was very dissapointed that It was not available for over a year. I thought it was discontinued like so many other great fragrences. Why do they do that? Im just glad it's back in stock again. ",5
1483,Clean Men has been out of stock for quite a while. I'm so glad it's back. I only had the chance to purchase one bottle before it was out of stock. I like this cologne alot because it really is the freshest and cleanest cologne I have ever tried. There's nothing wrong with smelling like you just stepped out of the shower. It truly has a very nice clean smell to it. ,5
1483,Clean should be called flowers. It has somewhat of a clean smell but more of a flower smell. It lasts for about three hours.I have been using Tsar for years will have to go back.,5
1484,I love Poopy Wildflower. Smells great!,4
1484,"Coach Poppy Wilderflower is a perfect Fall Winter sent. It’s warm with a touch of floral, and lasts forever!",5
1484,I smell the lily and pink pepper mostly. Disappointed I couldn't smell any patchouli. It smells good but not very memorable. This is def one for the spicy floral lovers.,3
1484,Love this fragrance an absolute must have ❤️,5
1484,"This perfume is very in your face floral. O think it might just be my body chemistry, but it smelled terrible on me. I couldn't smell any of the woody undertones that are supposed to be in this perfume, so it was a pretty huge disappointment. On the other hand if you love floral perfumes this perfume is for you. ",2
1485,"I have been using Dali since 1987 when I discovered at Bonwit Teller in Beverly Hills on vacation. One of the spritzer women sprayed my wrist and I fell in love with the elegant, sweet-spicey musky romantic scent. It's my only cologne and I hope they never stop making it. I get many compliments, too. Just wonderful!",5
1485,"Did review Salvador Dali in Nov, 2014 - its still just as elegant and exquisite. Subtle enough so that you have to be in my space to enjoy it - perfect for sensitive noses, today. Have worn it since its beginning and will wear it as long as it's around - try it, you wont be disappointed, I promise. . . .Mj P.S. Men seem to love it.",5
1485,"love my Salvador Dali is soft and a little spicy to me I have been wearing it for years. I bought the 3.4 partum design toiletries which is wonderful, and it stays on for along time. I give it 5 stars.",5
1485,This is an elegant fragrance - subtle but exquisite - one must be in your space to enjoy it which works well with so many sensitive noses. Have only ever had positive raves about it and routinely from men. Have worn it almost since it was introduced - nothing else quite like it for me. Ver had to find - thanks Fragrance Net. . . ,5
1486,"This scent sucks, nobody but me, should purchase it, so I can have it to myself. And no one else would smell this awesome!",5
1486,Emporio Armani Diamonds is the best ever. This smells so good and I ALWAYS get compliments when I wear it. Please don't ever discontinue this fragrance!!,5

1487, I ordered escentric molecules after finishing first bottle Love its so much ,5
1487,Great scent but it doesn’t last at all. I can barely smell it on even after I spray. ,1
1487,"I ordered escentric molecules 01 after trying a sample in a store. Totally intoxicating, it not only stays with you all day, but changes scent slightly throughout the day. Sooo many people have asked me what I was wearing which I have never experienced before. ",5
1487,"If you are addicted to fragrances, this is a must have. I’ve sampled the entire line and Escentric Molecule 01 is the one I landed on because it seems to enhance many fragrances I already have. This scent becomes a sharp and pleasant cedar on me that I use to balance some of my sweeter fragrances with. I grab this bottle almost everyday and enjoy wearing it alone when I hit the beach. I’m always getting compliments with this one...glad I was able to get the big bottle!",5
1487,I always have complements on this scent. Very beautiful and stays with you all day.,5
1488,F For Fascinating Love this! I always get told by both men and women how good I smell. Not quite sure why this is on clearance.,5
1488,Fascinating us the Perfect fragrance for any occasion anytime. I've had several compliments from men as well women. I give this Fragrance as gifts to my friends !!! I have lots of friends !! Lol. ,5
1488,F for Fascinating by Ferragamo is light but quite sexy. I bought when it first came out in 2008 and haven't looked back. It's one of all time favorite to wear anytime/anywhere to any event it fits. I receive compliments all the time and just purchase a bottle for my cousin as a gift and she's in love with it. I wear other fragrance but this is my all-time go to....,5
1488,THIS IS THE BEST PERFUME EVER! EVERY TIME I WEAR IT I GET ASKED WHAT IM WEARING AND WHERE THEY CAN GET IT! GUYS LOVE IT!! :),5
1489,"Hello my name is Donovan castell , and i would like to state in writting that i find the Karl Lagerfeld cologne very positive in regards to the responsiveness in scent , and style. Karl Lagerfeld as we all know , is very affluent German socialite ; so that gives more meaning , as well as credibilty to the brand. I am very pleased with my order , and in a very short while , i will re-order the item. Thank you for the courtesy.",5
1489,AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!,5
1489,This stuff smells great.,5
1489,Perfect i like it,5
1489,"this was something I ordered just to see how it smelled and it was soft, something that's not overpowering just the right spice for ever you need it for",4
1490,"I discovered this eau de parfum in Italy many years ago. Parfum D'Ete is floral, light and delicious. Am delighted to be wearing it again. It's hard to find. Yay, again for Kenzo!",5
1490,"Light but long-lasting, refreshing floral . Love the green notes. Perfect for daytime wear, but could be worn anytime. D'Ete is going to be one of my all-time favorites",5
1490,"Kenzo D'ete is my favourite perfume and sadly can't be purchased in any retail store, only online, so I'm over the moon that I was able to get more. It arrived in good time and well packaged. ",5
1490,Very pretty fragrance. The scent gets better the longer it's worn. A little goes a long way!,5
1490,"Kenzo D'Ete is as just as described - a combination of jasmine + green leaves. It is a flowery perfume but not overwhelming at all, not sweet like others, but with a hint of freshness added by greens. It is very nice combination but maybe hard to imagine, very subtle, last about 6 to 8 hours. However, when I sprayed it on clothes I could smell it even the next day. Refreshing definitely, good for any season of the year, and for any occasion but mostly for every day wear, and for any age as well. I would put in a range with Davidoff or Pleasures, seems very simple not offensive but distinctive and memorable at the same time. Enjoy! (would give 4.5 stars)",5
1491,"Maja de myrugia has been my favorite since I was thirteen. They have changed the formulation for the cologne from the original from the 1920s, and it can only rarely be found as a vintage item, the soap, made with olive oil, is unchanged and is great as a complexion soap as well as a fragrant shampoo. Not only do I receive complements from both sexes, it transports me to a magical place of beauty without fail!",5
1491,"Love all products Maja, and wear it, bathe in it and enjoy it immensely...5STARS def.! ",5
1491,I started wearing Maja many years ago after being in Spain. The hotel had the soap in the bathroom and I fell in love with the scent. When I came back to the states I could not find it here until I saw that Fragrance. Net had it. I immediately purchased it and get many compliments. It is musky scent that stays with you a long time. It is not overpowering. I always feel very sophisticated and European when I wear it. I give it a five star since the rating isn't working.,5
1491,I love Maja.... it is the best of the best.........................I use all of the products................... ,5
1491,I think of Maja soap as a fall/winter scent. No reason. After using in the shower you just feel like putting on a fuzzy sweater and sitting in front of a wood fireplace. With some hot chocolate. Jazz in the background.,5
1492,Nirvana rose is a head turner. Whenever I wear this fragrance I get tons a compliments. My signature scent.,5
1492,I’m truly a fan. My coworker gave me a sample of the Nirvana Rose and I’m hooked. When I wear this fragrance everyone stops me and ask what I’m wearing. It’s a head turner. Will order again,5
1492,"Nirvana Rose I don't like the way it smells. I somehow thought it would have a more rose petal smell, but this is far from it. Sorry, but it just doesn't work for me. Maybe I can give it away to someone that like the smell. I just dont, not even on plain paper.",1
1492,"Elizabeth and James Nirvana Rose: This is so warm and spicy with base notes of a dark musk and tobacco, then the smell of rose lingering behind. Lasts for hours!!! Very exotic. I love this!!!",5
1493,Very happy to have found my favorite in a body spray.,5
1493,Perry Ellis 360 is one of my favorite scents for special occasions. I had the cologne and when I saw the body spray I was so excited...had to purchase. My intention is to order the complete set. Waiting for a special coupon on pricing! Once again FragranceNet has become my one stop shop for body scents!!!!!! ,5
1493,I love perry 360 I know it's been around a while but it's ageless ,5
1493,I LOVE LOVE LOVE the 360 Perry Ellis Body Sprays! No body spray is as good as this one <3,5
1493,I love this scent. I have been wearing it for years,4
1494,Scent is to die for if you love sweet go for pink sugar everything...i did leaves skin nicely scented and smooth great body mousse,5
1494,"I have worn Pink Sugar EDT for well over 10 years now. I'm the past few years I've discovered the Luxury Extract (unbelievable!) and recently the hair perfume (what did I do without this?) and I am finally getting the body mist which has previously always been sold out. I wear this light yet intoxicatingly delicious fragrance every single day since discovering it. I truly do not feel like myself without it. I even buy an extra EDT and carry it with me in my purse to reapply whenever I want to. I get so many compliments on it and have gotten many friends, family members and co-workers all wearing it as well. It is not overpowering and does not leave that heavy Floral cloud around you much like many women's perfumes tend to do in my opinion. Everyone knows when I'm around and comments that I smell like cotton candy and I also hear people asking where the fresh baked cookies are?? Ha! I love smelling like such a nostalgic and playful smell that everyone seems to enjoy equally as much. I can't say enough about this scent. I only wish I could eat it too. That's my only suggestion for improvement! Please make it edible! ",5
1494,"Hello, I love, love love pink sugar I have it all but this body mousse. Can somebody tell me the difference between the body lotion and the body mousse? Does the body mousse smell more like the perfume? What I do to make sure people smell this beautiful fragrance on me is I use the body cream, then the body mist, then the perfume. I would love to know if the mousse is more like the body lotion or the perfume. Tanks so much. Ps the body mist is a must when I go to bed, and I spray it on my sheets and pillow! Beautiful fragrance!!! Thanks for anyone’s help I answering my question. Judy1121",5
1494,I love Pink Sugar and I am a young senior. It so reminds me of my youth filled days when I went to the carnivals for pink cotton candy. Wish you would add more product like a shower gel and moisturizer or even a sugar body scrub. ,5
1494," Pink Sugar body mousse by Aquolina I get compliments on this fragrance all the time. It seems to gain a new life when I start to get a little warm and gets a little stronger. I'm told it's light and very feminine. An aside. I touch a bit on the inside of my wrists at night and have happy, sweet, sexy dreams (could just be me but...)!",5
1495,Salvatore Ferragamo Uomo Signature is a sure delight. A masculine fragrance with a touch of leather and coffee based. Its unique and last very long.,5
1496,Sunny Diane is a very light smell of Diane. I love Diane and was sad to see you no longer have it. Diane is a longer stronger perfume!! Sunny Diane is ok it is a fresh smell but doesn't last long!!,3
1496,I love all of the fragrances that I bought I'm in the process of all new fragrances for my dresser !!!! More to buy,5
1496,Sunny Diane is a spring / summer scent. This is a clean light orange scent with a hint of wood on the dry down. Usually citrus or orange scents turn sour on my skin but this one doesn't do that. The orange scent fades quite a bit and settles down to light woody scent. This is not sweet and it is also not a soapy scent. This doesn't last that long on my skin but I don't mind reapplying. ,3
1497,My FAVORITE SMELL! I get at least 7 comments on how pleasant I smell!! I will buy over and over AGAIN!! ,5
1497,I absolutely love Tommy Bahama my favorite perfume by far. ,5
1497,I first tried TB Set Sail Martinique when I received it as a gift. I fell in love with it. Smells so fresh and is long lasting. I got lots of compliments wearing it so ordered another one thru FragranceNet. My daughter that was visiting loved it so much that I gave her my used one and have been wearing the new one I ordered. I just absolutely love it. I will for sure be ordering this one and others that I've ordered from them in the past. ,5
1497,Love the fragrance and is always way less expensive than purchasing in the store or the outlet. ,5
1497,My most favourite fragrance . Not too strong and have given as gifts and everyone says it's their new favourite ,5
1498,I LOVE IT HAVE USED IT 20 YEARS TOUJOURS MOI ,5
1498,"I have been wearing Toujours Moi for over 50 years. I have had people all over the place to stop and asked me what perfume I have on. Over the years, I have tried other scents, but end up coming back to Toujours Moi.",5
1498,"I have worn Toujours Moi for probably 50 years. In the beginning it was a scent to which I was not allergic. I have continued because I love end it and I get soooo many compliments when I am wearing it, even from strangers. I don’t know what I would do if they stopped making it. My eldest daughter also wears Toujours Moi and feels the same way I do, plus it is a fragrance she can tolerate with all her allergies.",5
1498,"I have been using Toujours Moi by Dana for over 40 years and it remains my very favorite.I hope it will remain on the market and on your site. I always get compliments when I wear this amazing scent! Thanks ,Marilyn Shrader",5
1498,Have worn Toujour Moi for years and always receive compliments. It’s my”signature scent”. My friends know I’m there before they see me. Can’t find it in stores anymore ,5
1499,I recently bought Valentino Valentina Aqua Floreale by Valentino. Nice floral fragrance for a night time event since its not a soft smell. Aldo comes in a beautiful bottle. ,5
1499,"Nice fragrance, not my most favorite, but nice.",4
1500,Alien body lotion by Thierry Mugler one of the best lotions and smell divine every body stop you and ask you what are you wearing I strongly recommend.,5
1500,Ever since Alien Body Lotion have been out I have purchase this item and I love it. Great smell ,5
1500,"I was introduced to Alien products since It was on the market and I still get compliments from everyone when I wear it. At work, co-workers would be calling my name before they see me. then when I appear, they would say that the could smell the scent. I love it.I have reccoment it to everyone that asked me. ",5
1500,Have not received the product as of today 2/21/18. Judy Bard ,5
1500,I love my Alien lotion. It's exactly what I ordered. Loved the price. I will order from you again!,5
1501,"Aqua Allegoria Mandarine Basilic is probably one of the best in the Aqua Allegoria line. Orange-citrus notes blend with basil to create a Mediterranean garden on the French Riviera. It like a spicy mandarin orange cocktail with hints of bitter orange, green tea, and sandalwood. Lovely and sophisticated, yet simple and earthy. ",5
1501,"I love my Aqua Allegoria Mandarine- Basilic EDT by Guerlain!!! The citrus notes are perfect for summer, and it's great for layering with other perfumes. Very fresh!",4
1501,Aqua Allegoria Mandarine-Basilic is a very fresh clean scent. It will last the whole day. I have received many compliments when wearing this scent. It one I will be ordering again!,5
1501,The best perfume I have ever found ..Love Love Love it ! Doesn’t disappoint.,5
1501,Guerlain's Aqua Allegoria derives it's greatest asset in not being like other scents. It belongs to the citrus group but has a slightly bitter bite to it as an under tone. Unusual with a great boon in not to smell like everyone else in the office elevator. Makes people's heads turn around. Who is wearing that scent? ,5
1502,Armaf Tag Him is a great fragrance very similar to Chanel Bleu De Chanel at a fraction of the cost. This is a smart purchase.,5
1503,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE! MUCH REGRETS THAT THE OPTION FOR THE 3.4 OZ IS NOT AVAILABLE. HOT ITEM!!! HOPING THE MILITARY POST LOCAL TO ME WOULD GET A SUPPLY OF IT VERY SOON. PERFECT GIFT FOR MY SISTERS! ,5
1503,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE! MUCH REGRETS THAT THE OPTION FOR THE 3.4 OZ IS NOT AVAILABLE. HOT ITEM!!! HOPING THE MILITARY POST LOCAL TO ME WOULD GET A SUPPLY OF IT VERY SOON. PERFECT GIFT FOR MY SISTERS! ,5
1503,"Does not smell like the regular SI EDP. This is a dark fruity, pear, vanilla, sweet, succulent scent. Reminds me of FOREVER RED from bath and bodyworks and I used to be obsessed with that perfume/lotion line. This took me back in time! It's perfect for date night, all seasons, get loads of compliments, moderate lasting. This gives me valentines day vibes, very sexy and men love it. ",5
1503,"I'm so glad FragranceNet got this beautiful and elegant fragrance in finally. This fragrance is a Christmas gift to myself. The top notes that I smell are the pink pepper, jasmine, and hints of vanilla! I don't really smell a woodsy notes but when it dries down it gets more floral and you pick up the pear and black current. I love it!",5
1504,excelente fragancia la recomiendo mucho!!!,5
1504, well all i can say is this was the first time i bought this cologne and i must say it's has a unique smell and i like it very much Bentley says it all ,4
1504,Elegante maderoso muy duradero de buena calidad,5
1504,Elegante muchas maderas y duradero ,5
1504,"Bentley Absolute, created by Michel Almairac, shares an almost identical formulation as his other well loved creation, Gucci Pour Homme (2003, the now discontinued original.) And the Bentley is a fraction of the cost. ",5
1506,"Donna Karan Liquid Cashmere White is a beautiful fragrance. Its a fragrance that is wore by my mother, and it smells wonderful on her. I love when she wears it. I can normally point her out by that scent, because not many people wear it. It's a long lasting perfume, but is not overpowering. ",5
1506,"Donna Karen Liquid Cashmere- This is the best fragrance mild,fleshing mild not strong, i get so many compliments on the fragrance is does not matter were I go, Dr'd office hospital, public it is fantastic. it is refreshing but mild and clean fresh smelling. Love it the best in many years as far as fantastic You will love it and get many compliments",5
1507,This is my first time trying a dry oil and I must say I was greatly pleased. Giorgio is one of my all time favorite scents. Love the sweet and clean smell.,5
1507,"Giorgio of Beverley Hills, is the #1 fragrance for me. I’m complimented everywhere I go. The fresh flowers scent to me is irresistible . I have a few other scents that I love, but none are like this. Absolutely feminine, & perfect",5
1507,"My husband loves all of the Georgio Beverly Hill fragrances, been wearing it for years, always get complements!",5
1507,"I am very sensitive to strong scents. After wearing a strong scent for an hour I am forced to wash it off before getting sick. That has never been the case with Giorgio. Not only can I wear it all day and touch up when needed but I am constantly being complimented on it's fragrance. The oil is great after the shower to help moisten my skin without that greasy feel, This is a winner in my book. Thank you for making it easy for me to locate and purchase.",5
1507,"I was sitting in my wheelchair, in line at the bank. Minding my own business. When the gentleman behind me leaned down. Quietly he said into my ear, ""your perfume scent is marvelously feminine. "". You can't get a better review than that for the original GEORGIO. Kat Stone, 12/2018",5
1508,Favourite hot summer scent. As it warms up throughout the day the scent becomes more fruity and less powdery. This has a sweet almost Litchi fruit cocktail scent. Very close to repurchasing for a third time.,5
1508,Hanae Mori parfum is beautifully feminine and light. Perfect for the office. ,4
1508,"I love this perfume! It smells so sexy and sweet! Men tell me that I smell amazing. No one has ever heard of this perfume, but it is beautiful!!",5
1508,ENJOYING THE JOYOUS SMELL!!!!,5
1508,"Hanae Mori ""Parfum"" pink/red butterfly box has been a scent I've worn in my 20's. As scents go, people will usually tire of it and move on to something new, then later go back to something that was pleasent and familiar, such as the case for me. In my 30's I went to a known retailer and sought out this perfume. There are 3 different types of this perfume, light, medium, strong and they all smell different with different undertones. I didn't know this at the time, only knew the color of the butterflies on the box (which represents the different strengths) and asked for the pink/red one, which was the strongest version or what is called ""parfum"" and what I have worn. They told me they where out of it and the other 2 lighter versions smelled the same, I'd didn't! I was bummed out and thought maybe over time it just had a different smell on my skin. Found this place and decided to give it a try and order the ""parfum"" pink/red butterflly box. Not disappointed in the least bit! The smell is EXACT and the cost, way cheaper than what you would pay at a high end retail store. This parfum (pink/red butterfly box) goes for almost a $100 in the stores. I'm picky as heck! I know what is fake or watered down. My bestie worked in a fragrance dept. for years and shared ""perfume 101"" with me. This is the real deal! As I'm typing this, Im smelling that wonderful old familiar scent that I wore in my 20's (now in my early 40's) and loving it! Buy the actual ""parfum"" red/pink butterfly box, you won't be disappointed! Scent starts of as powdery and light, than turns into a deeper scent, cannot really explain it. I've gotten tons of compliments when I wore it in my 20's. cannot wait to wear it again in my 40's. ",5
1509,"Guielan. Heritage. Very surprised about the aroma. It’s very sweet but pleasant. It remains me Channel perfume, my mother just love and wear Channel perfumes. ",4
1509,"Now on my third bottle of Heritage E.D.P, the comments keep coming.I use this as a signature fragrance and enjoy it so much. ",4
1510,It smells heavenly flowery I really like it,5
1510,Hollywood is a very nice fragrance.,5
1510,"I love Hollywood perfume, I have been wearing this perfume everyday for the last 20 years. Love it Love it !!!!!!",5
1510,Hollywood is a very nice fragrance.,5
1510,"Fantastic bottle, excellent fragrance, top notch service & delivery ",5
1511,Isaac Mizrahi-- Eau So Fabulous is the best cologne I have ever had. I get sooo many compliments when I wear it. If it was edible I would drink it. Beautiful cologne!!! ,5
1511,"When ordering the Eau So Fabulous by Isaac Mizrahi, I was not sure what to expect because I have never used any of his products before. I was blown away about how nice this fragrance is and it is long lasting. I REALLY LOVE IT. My daughter smelled it on me and asked me to order her one because she loved the fragrance just as well as I did so I ordered her one . I will definitely order more of this in the future when the need arises. ",5
1511,Love this perfume! Eau so fabulous by Issac Mizrahi is my favorite.I always get compliments on it. It's not overpowering but it lasts all day. ,5
1511,My sister and I stumbled upon this scent a few years ago while shopping at Kohl's. We liked it because it smelled very similar to Chanel's Chance fragrances which we love. It is the perfect scent for everyday wear and it last FOREVER. My sister purposely sprays it on her shirt sleeves so she can smell it all day. It is a refreshing citrus scent that I always get compliments on and all my friends love.,5
1512,Jaguar Red; Is very reminiscent of Burberry London. It has a cinnamon note but not overpowering. The dry downs the bomb. If u like Burberry London these two fragrances could be considered second cousins. ,5
1512,"Jaguar Classic Red! Wow! This EDT is an amazing and great scent. That said, the top note is a voluptuous mix of raspberry blueberry, and bergamot with a mix of floral jasmine and spicy pink/red pepper as a grounding dry-down. This merits a high recommendation as Jaguar Classic Red smells as great as a gourmand would be frothing for a flaky-crust raspberry and blueberry pie. GO FOR IT!",5
1512,Jaguar classic red !!! WOW !!! EXCELLENT TA !!!!!,5
1513,"I was looking to try something different, cuz my bestie stole my scent! So juicy culture Malibu was my pick!! And boy am I glad I did! It smells amazing and lasts all day without having to keep putting it on! I've only been rocking it about a week and I get complimented almost daily! Will definitely be re ordering this awesome find! Oh and the bottle is really pretty too!",5
1513,"I love ""Juicy Couture"" fragrance but Juicy Couture Malibu is a big NO!",1
1513,This fragrance is amazing. The scent stays on me for the entire day. I ordered 3 more bottles.,5

1513,Love it ! I get so many complements! Fresh not overpowering very feminine and very clean smelling ! ,5
1514,Marc Jacob's Daisy is a very smooth soft lovely fragrance to me I simply love it.,5
1515,Very Strong and fresh fragrance that last all day. Great at getting compliments around the office. Prada L'Homme Intense is my number one favorite scent.,5
1515,I bought Prada lomme intense recently and I do not like it. I love the Luna Rossa colognes but this does t work for me. My last date said it smelled more for a female. I’m good on this fragarance!,3
1515,I bought this one blind and looked forward to a different but first class fragrance. I was extremely disappointed in that I can take a bath in the fragrance and it lasts 10 maybe 15 minutes. I’ve applied it several different ways but to no avail. I’ve also sprayed it all over clothing but still no results. No since in talking about projection as it doesn’t last 5 minutes on the skin. A complete disappointment!! I’ll entertain any suggestions that would make this fragrance even marginal!,1
1515,this is a gem... glad this fragrance was not over hyped so not a lot of people use it.,5
1515," Prada L'Homme Intense smells great, got alot of compliments from women. Thank you for having it in stock!",5
1516,"This cologne is one of my favorite, the note is balanced oud, moss and patchouli and was done nicely.. I have tried TM Oud wood but this one if superior.",5
1516,This is the best Tom Ford ever made... magical and classy... smells like no other cologne ,5
1516,"Noir de Noir I love it, it's unique, different, they always ask me about my perfume",5
1516,"very long lasting, it is similar to Lyric man by amouage",5
1516,What can i say this perfume is freaking delicious chocolate and liqueur i cant get enough of it most guys wear it i find it to be very femenine is very sweet sexy long wearing great projection i bath on it i dont care i want to smell it all day hah ,5
1518,White Diamonds Body Talc is a great powder. Heavenly smell and silky feel. ,5
1518,I've been buying White Diamond products for about 15 years and I still think it is heavenly.,5
1518,White Diamonds talk. Was very pleased with them. ,5
1518,Great. Beautiful scent. Always a winner,4
1520,This is just as wonderful as alien the original,5
1520,"This scent is amazing. It's light enough to not be overpowering, but strong enough to know it's there, and to last my day at work. ",5
1520, Alien Sun essence edit BY Thierry Muglerthe is the best romantic perfume.,5
1520,"Alien by Mungler is one of the best fragrances ever made, I smell wonderful in it and my husband loves it on me. It have a very longevity for being an edt version but it still fresher and smells good. I do enjoy the scent more because it a lighter version of Alien in the purple bottle. This was the summer edition and I wear it all year long. All the Aliens are great and you cannot go wrong with any of them. Fragrancenet has been wonderful to work with and always has very kind customer care people. They always have a discount and out of the perfume companies online this one is my favorite.

1521,"Angel hair mist.I think is strong for mi,both smell good.",3
1521,I absolutely love the hair mist. I put it on my hair after I blow dry my hair and people tell me that I smell really good. It lasts all day. Now I'm hooked that I have to have it all the time. ,5
1521,My favorite scent! I layer the crepe perfume with the spray. This is a nice addition to my routine. Love it!,5
1521,Useful but a bit strong and not ideal for hair.,3
1522,"Oh my, this scent is gorgeous. It is fresh and subtlely sweet. It settles really nice on the skin. I prefer it just a tad more than the original Black Opium. I'd recommend it for anyone who's looking for an inoffensive scent that lasts on the skin. ",5
1522,Black opium floral shock the name talks about it!!! soooo hard to describe this fragrance ,5
1523,I ordered Bond No. 9 Nuits de Noho and love it! I get compliments all the time when I wear it. The scent lasts all day. Very happy with my purchase.,5

1524,I only use Dolce & Gabbana Shower Gel. It has an everlasting smell.,5
1524,I will not use anything else in my shower. It leaves an absolute wonderful fresh smell on her skin. I always keep an extra container so as not to run out. There is also the body cream. Helene,5
1524,Dolce Gabbana shower gel has a light and fresh fragrance. I always use this fragrance and found it to be cheaper on your website. I also like getting special offers and coupons. ,5
1524,"I'm using for long time Night Blue. Is my favorite perfume, and I love all Dolce Gabbana's smell products.",5
1527,"Elizabeth Arden Green Tee Cherry Blossom was just what I was looking for. I found it in a sample at a store and ordered it from FragranceNet on line. I wanted fresh with a bit of floral and this is it! Seems a little sweet when it is first applied but settles into a soft, subtle fragrance that can be worn anytime, anywhere. Very happy with it.",5
1527,"I love it the clean and citrus accent It's Lovelly for every one., I just love it Good Job Elizabeth Arden!., My favorite!!!. Green tea cherry blossom..",5
1527,"I guess not every perfume will work for everyone,but this one works for both me and my grandmother. I'm an asthmatic and she has a stomach disorder,and this green tea & cherry blossom scent is just right. I can use it and breathe easily while she doesn't feel nauseous at the smell. Well done,Elizabeth Arden.",5
1527,I like the Elizabeth Arden Green Tea selections all except this one. Reminded me of the cheap dime store perfume . Put on and could not really smell the Cherry. Also ask my husband and he said it did not have a nice smell. I gave to my housekeeper..maybe she will wear it. ..maybe not. ,2
1527,"Green Tea Cherry Blossoms is a soft, clean, sweet floral scent, that's not too, too much. It's perfect for a confident woman, who understands the seductive power of fresh bouquets. ",5
1528,"Personally, I found the violet to be funky and bit cloying, although I can see where some might find it appealing. Performance was pretty poor, which is disappointing given the price relative to some other fragrances. ",2
1528,"Excellent product, love it. He Wood Rocky Mountain",5
1528,"He Wood Rocky Mountain is one of the best fall, autumn ,and spring. Very natural woody, and floral, this is one of the best out of the He Wood line,it almost smells like Dior Homme Sport 2012 but stronger, and rich, you could probably do dior homme sport during the day, and rocky Mountain wood at night! ",5
1528,I asked my daughter what she thought. She said it smells a little girly. I'll try it but not real sure. ,4
1528,"Obviously the name gives you much of what you need to know. It's heavy wood but strikes a good chord with a surprising floral feel. If you named it just a 'woody' fragrance you might be caught off guard by the floral notes. Now right from the first spray, the musk opens this scent up. Then the violet & Canadian lily takes hold. And finishes up with the Vetiver & Cedar. Very composed & linear fragrance. All the notes are present & noticeable. Very Natural. Very Unique. Very noticeable. All ages can wear this. 5 sprays and you're good to go. Lasts long (8-10 hrs). Fall & Winter would be recommended. Great Projection. Can't say enough. Definitely grab this for a unique & casual 'outdoors' scent.",4
1529,Incognito has a great scent. I bought it for my wife and have had numerous people ask where they can get it. It is very intoxicating! ,5

1531,"Wonderful smell from the past. They quit making Kanon for quite a few years and I thought I might never get the chance to wear it again! It has a bit of an exotic smell to me, and is a very clean not sweet smell as well. Not overpowering, but it's there for those that get close to you! Best of all it's unique so you don't smell like the herd!",5
1531,My Grandfather used to wear Kanon Cologne. I just love the way it smells. I found and I was all over it. I guess good cologne just runs in the family.,5

The price is good since it is hard to find, unless it's through ""FragranceNet"". Thank you. ",5

1560,"I could not believe my nose after the first whiff of Charlie Gold. It's so soft, sexy and most definitely ladylike. The price is unbelievable for a daytime fragrance,but you know what,I'd rather spend less to smell this good. As the famous saying goes: ""Old is Gold.""",5
1560,My grandmother wore this Charlie gold fragrance for years before passing away almost two years ago. The house always smelled so good whenever we visit her & she always had the neighbors and special guests coming over for dinner or just to hang out. I couldn't bring myself to wear it for fear of crying in public but I sucked it up and it felt like her spirit was with me. Just a beautiful fragrance that has given me golden memories of my beloved grandma.,5

1561,Sud Pacifique Vanille Abricot smells so very good. I received a sample of this in an order from another store and fell in love with it.

1562,"Depends on my mode, but I kind of half like this perfume. It has a slight musky woodsy undertone under the rose scent, so I haven't worn it very often. I sprayed some on my hair to freshen up and that was nice throughout my day. My kid says it smells nice on me, but in my opinion it's a bit heavy. Great day time scent.",4
1562,"Tried this after it arrived. It has a strong rose/musk/woodsy scent, and after dry down it’s a strong mostly rose/woodsy note. Not sure if I will wear this very often, but the bottle is lovely for displaying. I think I may prefer the original Cool Water to this new fragrance. Arrived on time and safely. Great deals on this website!",4

1565,Fahrenheit parfum i liked it the fragance is diferent strong is for my son in Peru he is happy fragance net send me very fast thank you,5
1566,"I used Quadrille by Balenciaga for years but could no longer find it any where. Several years ago a friend suggested Femme as a substitute. I love Femme and wear it for every occasion. It has become ""my scent"" and fits my style and personality. I consider it to be oriental/spicy but it is subtle and definitely not overpowering. ",5
1566,"Femme Rochas was a gift to me when I was a teen. I've always equated it with sensuality, elegance, richness. When applied, you have a warm response. If I have a special event, this is my go-to. it is like a rich dessert, not fresh and flowery, but a spicy Christmas punch. It may be my favorite fragrance. I did not find it again until my '40's. This site is the only place I've seen it regularly available.",5
1566,Romantic and mysterious. I love it.,4
1566,"I initially received Femme by Rocha as a gift in the 1980''s when BFF ordered from I Magnin and she did not like the fragrance. It is a very sensual fragrance and at that time the body crème and powder were available as well. Lost track of where I could purchase, then discovered at this site two years ago. Was overjoyed to rediscover it and just ordered two more bottles with discounted price and free shipping. The fragrance is not heavy and can be worn year round. Once you discover a classic fragrance such as Femme you never forget it. I believe it was developed in 1942 and was Audrey Hepburn's favorite. ",5
1567,I love to have people say how wonderful I smell & what is that you are wearing I tell them Gucci Premiere the best perfume in the world,5
1567,I love it!! The scent is clean but very sexy.,5
1568,"My favorite perfume; purchased locally (Guam, USA) but no more. So frustrated to find here but always Sold OUT! Getting lots of email adds but no notification that it's back in stock. Too bad; been long time. 5 Star perfume, 0 star availability. ",5
1568,I don't regret buying this fragrance from Jovan. The ladies were really helpful in their reviews & the scent is absolutely gorgeous. I've gotten many great compliments about it. ,5
1568,Jovan Island Gardenia is my favorite daytime fragrance; I've worn it for many years an received many compliments. The scent is not overwhelming yet lasts throughout the entire day. I highly recommend it to anyone wishing a light floral cologne.,5
1568,If you love the scent of gardenias .... this is the fragrance for you! This is the perfect summer scent for the office and not overpowering. I love the true gardenia fragrance.,5
1568,"Living on Maui I can get all kinds of gardenia fragrances but I have been using Island Gardenia by Jovan since I was 20...I am 64 now! Unfortunetly, its very hard to get this perfume here so I am pleased to be able to get it from Fragrances!",5
1569,"Obsessed... My fav! Can't wear anything else. Wish I could find the ""midnight"" version too. Always get compliments and barely notice that I'm wearing it. Also looking for the blue coral one in the clear bottle. They're so hard to find and when I do find it here, I stock up. ",5
1569,Love the fragrance Si Lolita. Really in love with bottle. Would recommend this site to friends and family. I like how secure and fast my order was sent.,5
1569,"I am obsessed with Lolita perfumes so I went on a purchase frenzy and bought several of her collection. This one I must say its more of a cologne scent than a perfume scent. Needles to say, its a very good scent for a man which is why my husband snatched it for himself and now loves it. Best way to describe it is a soft spicy scent. Hub likes spicy colognes...his other top choice is SPICEBOMB by Viktor & Rolf. Win win situation for me. :) If you are looking for something subtle and ""sweet"" get the l'eau en blanc (the sweetest one of her line in a powdery kind of scent) or less sweet yet AMAZING is her lolita lempicka perfume (in a purplish bottle packaged in a neon green box). Enjoy!",5
1569,"Perfect fragrance, light and fresh. Delicious! My favorite perfume.",5
1569,Happy I bought the sample instead of full size as I'm not fond of this. Doesn't smell feminine. ,5
1570,Yes i love it!!,5

1574,Passion by Elizabeth Taylor is very sensuious ,4
1574,"Passion by Elizabeth Tayor is my ""always go back to"" fragrance when I am doing anything special or just to please myself. It retains the fragrance longer that most. No matter how my body chemistry changes, this seems to be just right.",5

1575,"No eh visto reseñas en español de este perfume pero la verdad huele muy rico suave como un algodón de azúcar y un toque de vainilla, iba a comprar otro perfume el de Ariana Grande pero cuando olí este perfume en la demostradora me encanto y mejor compre Sexual Sugar buenísimo es un olor exquisito y si dura mucho el olor en la piel.

1577,"Not super fond of this one. Purchased a sampler to try it out, but found it to be too strong.",2
1577,"Versus Versace is my go-to fragrance for any day or occasion . I receive compliments on the scent every time I wear it. Difficult to find in stores, though !",5
1577,"Decided to try this fragrance and I'm glad I did. Its a great change from my usual CKs. This has become one of my new regulars. It is not overpowering, but lasts all day. My husband and I both love it.",5
1578,This is number one cologne by Amouage. it last all day long and worth every penny .,5
1578,Interlude Man is a MASTERPIECE. Simply devine. Campfire and incense.,5
1578,"""Wow"" this is one of the most greatest cologne for mens I have ever smelt. it lasts all day. I have had many compliments both men and women asked what is it that I am wearing this is number one Amouage Interlude.",5
1578,"What a powerful mixture of perfection. I want to wear it everyday, but the dare to be different causes me switch to another of these great aromas produced by this designer and when your five year granddaughter exclaims “you smell good”.What else can I wear?",5
1578,This cologne smells thousands of years old. But in a good way. If Jesus was to have worn cologne. I would imagine it would have smelled like this. I have had a few compliments the one time I wore it. My son is 18 and wore it to college and had a few compliments. I plan on wearing it to church this Sunday and test it out. To me it smells like Ancient religion or Christmas in a bottle.,5
1581,A friend gift to me like 8 years ago and I can’t stop To use it ,5
1581,"I love my Eva by Eva Longoria perfume, it is light yet very special, I wear it every day.",5
1581,"Eva perfume- Fragrant woodsy scent. Light, refreshing, unique. ",5
1581,"I recently purchased Eva by Eva Longoria and I'm undecided about this fragrance. It's rather woodsy with green undertones and my preference is usually for floral, powdery fragrances. When you first put it on, there's an odd note that's rather off-putting, but as it dries down, it smells better. It's OK, but I I don't think I'd buy it again. I suspect the ""leather-based"" elements are giving it that ""odd note"" - it just doesn't work on me. ",5
1581,"Its unusual and quite playful. I had a man open a store door for me and when I walked away he said"" you smell nice."" Now that I'm a widow I was very flattered. I was very surprised.",5
1582,Ok...so my sister came up for a visit. She took a shower & got herself together. When I walked into the room where she was standing. I said OMG! What is the beautiful sent that I'm smelling? She said oh... this is called Fcuk. I then asked can I use some & she said yes. I just knew that I was smelling good. I purchased some for myself. Everyone that I come in contact with loves it! All of my Occupational Therapist & Physical Therapist is now purchasing Fcuk French Connection. Oh...& It lasts for hours on end! I own several bottles.,5
1582,I was really amazed at how much I like this fragrance. It's feminine yet light enough to wear anytime and it lasts for the whole day and into the night. It's the type of fragrance that does not give you a headache after some time of constantly smelling it. Great price too!,5
1582,"Bought it for my Daughter, for the second time. She loves its' subtle notes. In my opinion, it is for younger ladies, not for the mature women.",4
1582,Fcuk is a light smelling fragrance that does not match my body chemistry. I live a strong sweet perfume and this was not it. The scent does not last on me.,3
1582,Brought this for my Grandmother for the 4th time. It is one of her favorites. ,4
1583,"Truly disappointed by this perfume. I had tried the regular Green Tea perfume in the past and as far as I remember once you wore it the odor lasted for several hours, but unfortunately that is not the case with the Green Tea Honeysuckle, I feel like I just wasted my money. It has a pleasant odor, but I need to spray it on my hair and clothes (which is not recommended) to at least make it last longer. I won't buy it again.",1
1583,Green Tea Honeysuckle is just as described. Was pleasantly surprised. Nice fragrance. Won't be disappointed.,5
1583,Green Tea Honeysuckle - I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! The smell is AMAZING. Hard to describe other than really clean and fresh.,5
1583,One of my favorites it smells of citrus and tea it reminds me of having earl gray and greapfruit for breakfast at a resort,4
1583,It would have been a great floral scent but it triggered my seasonal allergies. It's quite strong when you first spray it on. It's great for summer or on a hot weather. *For women 35 and up,3

1595,This is my first purchase of a unisex scent. I only bought a vial to test it. Something in it triggered an allergic reaction. I will likely try some others. ,2
1595,"This one by Bond No. 9 smells like the cleaner I use for removing mildew in the shower. I don't know if it's the industrial fragrance they use, but it smells like the same fragrance in the mildew cleaner. It is not pleasing to me, and, in fact, many people have complained about the scent, asking where is that rancid odor coming from. I will pass. This is not a good fragrance investment.",1

1598,"L'Hadrien is the single most perfect scent I have ever worn. I have tried many, many and nothing feels as good, stays as long, or causes other people to ask ""what are you wearing?"" as L'Hadrien does. The words that describe it best are ""delicious"" and ""fresh"".",5

1600,Reminds me of hot and humid tropical areas. un-ripe oranges,5
1601,This scent is simply AMAZING! I tested Jadore in Joy at a retailer where it is priced well over $100. I cannot afford to pay that right now for something discretionary. I am glad to see it priced better here. I have the original Jadore so I know this will become a favorite of mines.,5

However, others always smell the scent and love it!",5

1605,"Rochas Man edt for men is a very pleasant smooth fragrance. This is a mellow, semi-sweet fragrance with notes of coffee, raspberry, & vanilla. The sweetness is not too strong thus you could probably wear this even in the summer. I like Rochas Man so much that I wish it was a little stronger & that I had a gallon of it. Especially for the price it is worth a try. ",5

1607,"My favorite fragrance used to be Anne Klein 11. That was discontinued and I tried for months to find a fragrance I liked enough to buy it. I found Tocade and hope that it will never be discontinued. So many people have told e ""you always smell so good"". I tell them what I am wearing and recommend they buy it also. It is a subtle fragrance, not overbearing, lasts a long time, and is just what I like. I will use this fragrance most of the time. I only use something else if I am going someplace I don't go very often just for a change. TOCADE ROCKS!!",5

There are two Tom's in my life Tom Ford in fashion, and Tom Dixon in interior design ~ Love Love Love ~",5

1614,Best bond no 9 to me..Blind bought it and I Loveee it,5
1614,"Absolutely amazing fragrance. I don't believe I've ever tried a unisex fragrance. I couldn't imagine this on a woman personally. My girlfriend loved the way it smells on me and hates when I wear it and she's not around. That's how much attention this gets. Also, a little bit goes a long way. Although I couldn't smell it anymore, she swears it was still present on me more than 12 hours later. I don't know. Awesome purchase. Satisfied customer.",5
1614,This Cologne is excellent!!!,5
1614,"I real enjoy New York Nights smell this make me feel someone special, it put a smile on my face it stay with me all day I love me some Bond No 9 ",5

1615,"Hmmm, Golden delicious eh...love this scent. Not really that sweet as in flowery sweet,but the mild kind of sweet that doesn't overpower you or those around you. Think Burberry London at almost half the price if you like that one. ",5
1615,I love DNky Delicious by Donna Karan it's fantastic ,5
1615,"DKNY golden delicious....Interesting but pretty scent. I did not know what it smelled like until I tried a sample of it at the mall,and it's truly a warm floral for anyone that cannot wear or don't like strong scents at all. The only con for me is that it doesn't last long so I'll be buying the lotion to enhance the scent further on my skin. ",4
1615,"Lovely scent, just what I've been looking for. Golden Delicious is the perfect name for this perfume. Lightly floral with just a touch of an oriental note,at least that's what my nose picked up on. No headaches or allergies taking place here,so this is definitely a keeper.",5
1616,This is the best scent. i have been obsessed with it since i bought it at the store ,5

1617,"Givenchy Dahila Noir has a nice scent that can be worn on all occasions. It doesn't take much to light up the magic. The bottle was much smaller than what it looks in the photo, but learning now to order lager bottles in the future. ",4
1617,Givenchy Dahlia Noir is worth buying,4
1617,Jivenchy Dahlia Doir is the type of perfume you can where for all occasion I would recommend it for all ages ,4
1617,I usually gravitate towards orientals but this is my absolute favorite floral - classy and reminds me of how you feel when you wear the perfect little black dresa.,4
1617,"This is a strong-smelling, dressy perfume. I think it's beautiful and I wear it during the day, though it would be good for a date. Not sporty or woodsy.",4
1618,Love the scent. Lasts longer than 2 other lavender scents I've tried. ,4
1618,"I love this lavender & green tea scent. It reminds me of my late grandmother who loved gardening in her spare time. She had a green house with many varieties of flowers and herbs and lavender was always a part of her garden. That unforgettable scent just wafts through her house whenever it rains & she'd always pick some to make her own infused oils. Ah,simple times gone by. Hope this scent does not retire any time soon. ",5
1618,Green Tea Lavender by Elizabeth Arden Scent is personal and I found this harsh and unpleasant. ,2
1618,"This Green tea and lavender scent is exactly what I thought it would be. I work in a nursing home and the elderly people can't always be subjected to strong smells,especially perfume. This and the regular green tea are the only scents I'll wear that they're most comfortable with because it relaxes them as well as myself.",5
1618,"Elizabeth Arden Green Tea Lavender Very pleasant scent. Wish, it hold longer.",5
1619,I love my Gucci Flora by Gucci ,5

1620,"Nice scent, great price long lasting. U can't go wrong with this app. ",5
1621,"No matter what fragrance the experts come up with, nothing has a more significant chemical reaction with the pleasure cener of the brain as the smell as musk, Hands down, They know it. The rest is expensive foder, commerciallization of this product makes it to cheap for the rich and aimless to put on there bathroom sinks.",5
1622,I'm very happy with it. ,5
1622,Very nice and fresh scents ,5
1622,"Marry Me! by Lanvin is a very flowery, romantic type of perfume you can wear for that special someone or on a night out on the town. It smells mostly like roses with a few other subtle scents thrown in. It lasts a long time and is pleasant to the nose. People will ask you what you are wearing when they get close to you.",5
1622,This is the only perfume I wear! I love it and I get compliments on it all the time!,5
1623,Trust me you will not go wrong with this fragrance. It’s absolutely amazing. It’s is very masculine and grab lots of attention. The drydown on the skin is wonderful! I smelled this at a kohl’s store. I sprayed it on my hand and I literally couldn’t stop smelling it throughout the whole day. I fell in love with it and had to get me a bottle. One of my absolute favorite. ,5
1623,"This gets compliments! The opening IMO is ok...but its in the drydown where this gets amazing,and this stage lasts till the end. The fragrance lasts all workday and a bit more..id say by hr 6 its a great skin scent w/still some sillage. A great fragrance for an everyday activity or close encounters. Not for formal settings really. Love this one and as i mentioned this gets compliments esp from women. I get ""you smell deliciious"" quite a bit.",5
1623,Love it I'm on my second bottle ,5
1624,"My husband bought me a bottle from France over 20 yrs ago and I wore it everyday, and everyday people would come up to me of all ages and ask me what i was wearing that it smelled so good. and I loved it and than it was hard to find and I finally found it again in a perfume shop. Then they went out and I have not worn it in over 10yrs an now that I see that you have it I am going to have my husband buy it for me for mother's day.",5
1624,Montana has been my go-to perfume since the first time I smelled it on a woman on the plane when I was coming back from Europe more than twenty years ago. It is bold yet pleasing and lasts when others fade. I always wear it when traveling because of the memories it invokes,5
1624,Montana by Claude Montana is one of the top three that I wear - I love it. It is a lasting fragrance that I wear anywhere at any time for any occasion. If you like spicy scents you can't go wrong with using Montana.,5
1626,Love it!! The smell is very sweet sugary that's why I love it but the stay power is like 3hours I am keeping it in my collections I always wanted to try Paris Hilton perfume and this was the one I wanted to add in my collections ,5
1626,Love it Very sweet ,5
1627,Perry ellis 18. It is really nice. I got it for my daughter. She loves it. Thanks,5
1627,"Perry Ellis fan here since 1995. Just like one of the reviewers,I've been using 360 for about two years then changed to the 360 red & white. All three fragrances suit me perfectly. Now I am in absolute love with P.E.18. It's fabulously feminine and sexy from start to finish. I know that Mr. Ellis is no longer here in the flesh,but he's definitely left behind a great legacy for us to enjoy. Thank you ladies and R.I.E.P kind sir. ",5
1627,"Damn,I can't believe I've missed this one. Perry Ellis 18 is a beautiful,beautiful fragrance that should be worn by every woman. The price is perfect in my opinion and I get many great compliments on it too,so what more could I ask for? Will definitely buy again and please bring back the lotion if possible. ",5
1627,"I am ecstatic at this wonderful fragrance from Perry Ellis. I wished I didn't take so long to discover this,but you know as with all things,the timing has to be right. And 18 is worth the wait,it's a very warm & inviting scent that lingers with your every move. Giving this as an early Christmas gift to a cousin who ironically is turning 18 pretty soon,& myself too. Happy holidays all.",5
1627,"This is the perfect fragrance for anyone turning eighteen. Perry Ellis 18 is a beautiful combination of fruity & floral notes that will surely get the young lady in your life noticed.

1628,"Quelques Fleur Royale is a beautiful fragrance. Loved the notes given in the description, decided to try it. Great choice as it seduced me all day.",5
1628,"Absolutely beautiful fragrance. It is elegant, soft, woodsy and floral. I receive many complements while wearing it. Even though this site does not offer the body cream, I highly recommend it. This perfume lasts for hours when layered with the cream. They do offer the body lotion on this sight. The lotion is nice but not the same. I'm using it until they begin offering the body cream. The cream is very expensive in department stores.",5
1628,This is my new favorite...so fabulous you will love it too. It's the kind of scent that is good all year at any time ,5
1628,I love ❤️ it!,5
1629,The Versace Signature for men smells sexy and I love it on my husband's body for date night.,5
1630,I love the gentil smell of Vince Camuto spray...it goes on like a perfume but is a body spray...,5
1630,Vince camuto mist was exactly what I hoped it would NOT be. One spray and I was overpowered the heavy scent of someone's grandmother. Too strong too pungent borderline nostril burn. I could not wait to get home and wash my clothing. Not for me. Zero stars isn't an option so I give it a one.,1
1630,"I am thrilled with the Vince Camuto body mist! I am 48 years old, and I was looking for a mature scent that had personality, and didn't make me smell like an elderly lady. Long lasting. You and others can smell it, but it's not going to waft behind when you exit an elevator. ",5
1630,Vince Camuto body mist . Exactly as described. Can't beat the price.,5
1632,"Armani Si intense Parfum is a favorite. My son loves it on me, everyone ask you what you are?",5
1632,"I have Armani Si, Armani Si Intense and Armani code. All of these bought by my wonderful husband of 32 years. Known each other for 41 years. He knows my taste in perfume and he hasn't gone wrong with the Armani brand. I usually only put it on once a day in the morning but still get asked late in the day or evening ""What is that perfume you are wearing it is so lovely on you!"". That says it all.",5
1632,"Armani Si is such a classy fragrance. Each time I wear it, I feel pretty and complete. It is not overwhelming like some perfumes. It has a slight vanilla note which makes it warm and comforting. ",5
1632,"Armani Si intense Where do i begin, Aaamazing perfume. The first day i wear this perfume. I got compliments after compliment. One guy took out his cell phone to write the name down. Stating this is my wife next gift. Love Si intense",5

1633,"I discovered Bal A Versailles when I was 15 years old, just 3 years after this incredible fragrance was launched. At that time, it was the most expensive perfume in the world so I was very careful not to waste a drop, something I still do. Bal A Versailles is the only fragrance I will ever wear. After 50+ years, I still adore it! Artemise",5
1633,"Bal A Versailles is my mom's favorite since I was a little girl. This is the only fragrance she'll wear. The scent is one of a kind!!! When I smell it, I think of my mom.",5

1634,"CK All is much better than CK One, and lasts a LOT longer. Longevity is not a problem at all for me, it’s on par with (or better than) the rest of my EDT’s. This is a more crisp and masculine version of CK One, less flowers and more citrus/freshness, and it is a light, every day, casual scent. It is still unisex, take that into consideration, but it absolutely leans more masculine than CK One, and overall a much better scent. I’ve owned many, many CK scents and this is in my top 3.",4
1634,"CK ALL, smells nice, but VERY LIGHT, didnt seem to last either. Wont get it again.",1
1634,"This is a really good fragrance by CK but it doesn't last long. In my opinion, it is not an 'all' as in for all sexes. It smells much more masculine. Underneath you can get hints of CK One (which I don't care for) but with an additional spicey/woodsy vibe. It's like they left something out of CK One and added it to CK All to make one of the best fragrances that has come around in a long time. Now if only it would last it could easily become my signature scent. ",5
1635,"Love this fragrance, get so many compliments",5
1635,If you like Miss Dior Cherie this one is for you!,5
1636,"I fell in love with this fragrance, the 1st time I smelled it. It is like walking through an orange grove, when the unripened fruit still clings to the trees. There is no smell to equal it, and no memory like it. If you ever lived in Florida or California, and wandered through an orange grove, and were in heaven, this is your scent, this one right here.",5
1636,"Thanks, surprisingly, it met my high standard. I very much love it and will not hesitate to recommend it to others.",5
1636,hermes d'orange is a wonderful familiar but mysterious fragrance that surrounds and follows like a soft breeze. ,5
1636,Hermes-dorange vert concentre is an all time favorite fresh clean fragrance The price is less than when I go on a cruise and shop at the duty free shoppes,5
1636,"This is my go to fragrance. It is elegant and you cannot go wrong with this. I usually use this in warmer months, smelling orange and spices. This is for more mature men. ",5
1637,'Hypnose Homme' is by far the best kept secret of men's aftershave. ,5
1637,This is the 3rd time that I bought for my husband it smells so so so good I can never get enough of it love it. ,5
1637,My boyfriend introduced me to Hypnose and I crave his scent all the time. ,5
1637,Hypnose for men is one of the best fragrances for men out there. It turns heads and I love it on my husband. ,5
1639,"I bought this perfume when someone that walked by had it on. I fell in love with it instantly and once I found out what it was, I decided to order it. I love it! ",5

1641,"I would give the Lutece Zero stars if it was possible, the new scent is HORRIBLE ! I have wore Lutece for over 35 years. They also had shower gel, body powder. I recently purchased 3 bottles, a big mistake I gave them to my sister. The only thing I have now is the body powder. It smell nothing like the original scent. They changed the chemistry of this scent ( eau de parfum ) the Lutece Toliette was the best ! Please bring back the original scent. So Sad ! ! ! ",1
1641,Years ago I used Letuce and loved the scent. It does smell great but I am not sure if it is the original scent. Delivery time was great! Thanks!,5
1641,I ordered three different products everyone were fine except the Lutuice it absolutely smells horrible I already threw away the receipt or I would send it back I’m going to call customer service and see if anything could be done but the other products were wonderful ,1
1641,"Lutece has been my scent for 30 yrs. Wherever my family goes, this scent will always bring thoughts of me. It’s so rare to find someone else wearing this scent. Please keep producing Lutece for those of us lucky enough to know about it. Years ago a man said the scent should be named LaTease! ",5
1641,"I know this isn't the original Lutece, but I think it's just as nice; in fact, I've gotten quite a few compliments just about every time I've worn it. It's definitely a keeper! This is made by Five Star Fragrances, whereas the original was made by Houbigant, then Dana, in later years. ",5
1642,"I have never completely used an entire bottle of any scent but this one. I kept it with me every where I went. Smells so awesome and lingers. Most scents fade so quickly, not this one. Love, love, love it!!!",5
1642,By far my favorite scent!!+,5
1642,"Sexy Rio de Janeiro is one of my favorite Michael Kors fragrances! I smelled this while shopping and sampling perfumes a couple of months back, and really liked it. So when I saw it on this site for this price, I immediately ordered it. I'm so glad I did, it smells amazing! They really tease you with the hint of sweet mango, but the floral and vanilla scents really make up for it. Note: It smells better on your skin than on your clothes. ",4
1642,Michael Kors....Sexy Rio De Janeiro is just that... SEXY !! mmmmmmm............... smells Divine !!! :),5
1642,Michael Kors Sexy Rio De Janiero is a fruity fragrance made for young ladies. Nice scent,5

1643,Wow. This is different. Very Cool Fragrance. Much like Midnight Poison.,2
1643,Perles of Lalique is a memorable fragrance. My 13 year old daughter comments on the scent every time I wear it. I can't wear strong fragrance or I'll get a headache. Once it settles it is the freshest scent in my opinion. I absolutely love it!,5
1643,Perles De Lalique... Love it,5
1645,The reviews the you are reading are extremely correct. No lies on this perfume!! I spray myself at store in the mall and the next day its still on me. Driving home i could smell myself. I wanted me if you know what mean.,5
1645,"The Rihanna kiss smells great, and I love the way the bottle is made. Plus the scent lasted awhile",5
1645,"I own EVERY Rihanna perfume, but this one is absolutely ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!! The bottle itself is beautiful, let's start there. The smell is very flirty, feminine, and sexy. It lingers wherever you go and is long lasting for sure. She picked the perfect fragrance combo to go with the name. I love this perfume; definitely for a warm weather fragrance!",5
1645,"Rihanna Kiss fragrance smells so soft and sexy, my niece had some oil she bought from some place... I was hypnotized since... But I got the Real Deal here!!! I am even more loving the design of the bottle alone! Nice!!!",5

1649,"Since age 15 this has been my #1 after shave. I have several, but Aqua Di Gio, by Armani is my best. Age 54, and started at age 15, you do the math, I do use others, but the softness and attracted smell has been a big winner for me. Through 6 females in my life and (friends) its the best. I do use other high price colognes, but they just don't do what GIO does for me. I simply love it.",5
1649,"Acqua Di Gio, After Shave Lotion. I'm very sensitive to strong colognes and can get an almost instant headache & slight difficulty breathing when someone wears strong fragrances.

1655,Soft and lingering scent of confidence and assurance.... a new and great addition to my list of choices for fragrances ..... masculine and impressive.. ,4
1655,"Intimately Beckham, upon application exhibits a strong attention grabbing masculine scent. Unfortunately the scent fizzles out after a very for short period (30 minutes or so). If you have a specific occasions where an immediate but short reaction/appreciation for a scent is is required, Intimately Beckham is perfect. Not recommended, however as an all day scent. ",2

The scent stays with you all day long and all evening long, too. Thank you, Jessica McClintock, for giving us Jess and Jessica McClintock!",5
1656,I am so pleased I finally have my scent back. I used to wear JESS by Jessica Mclintock and then they stopped making it. That was the only scent I ever wore so I went back to my old favorite Lou Lou. I know there are a lot of perfumes out there but JESS is the only one I like... I always get asked what is that you are wearing... Do you think they will come ou with the location and bath gel? Thank you for bring it back. I was just surfing the net and came across the Jessica McClintock line and wondered if Modern Jess was the same as Jess. So glad I ordered it. One happy camper!!!! Keep it coming!!!,5

1660,L'Eau D'Issey Pure Nectar De Parfum is much sweeter than traditional L'Eau D'Issey bit still with the deep traditional scents underneath. ,4
1661,"I was given this as a gift after telling my cousin how much I liked it and now it is my signature fragrance!

1662,"Madame Gres - Possibly the most beautiful fragrance I have experienced in years. Always loved Cabotine, but this is a totally different type of fragrance. Not a teen fragrance or sugar water, but it has the elegance of the 30's or 40's. The initial fragrance is nice, but ahhh, let it age on your skin. Beautiful.",5
1663,"Amazingly delectable, but sexy, boozy, bourbon vanilla type scent with a deep rose! You will turn heads. ",5
1663,"This is the best Montale ever, it lasts for long hours.",5
1663,"Montale Paris Intense Cafe is amazing!!! Words don't do it justice. I don't pick up much of a coffee note, but the vanilla is delicious! It evolves on your skin throughout the day. It seems to transform as you wear it. Blind buy worthy for sure!",4

1666,"Best perfume I ever had. Although I tried others over the years, I always come back to this sophisticated and elegant fragrance. Very hard to find Sublime by Jean Patou where I live, so thank you so much for offering it on your website.",5
1666,I just love Sublime by Jean Patou... A friend offered me that perfume when I was in my 20'. I liked it but at that time I had other perfumes that I wore more often. Maybe I was too young to really appreciate its uniqueness Over the years I tried other perfumes but had never been able to find one that I like as much as Sublime. I am now a mature women and this fragrance suits me even better. It is an elegant and sophisticated fragrance that reminds me of the classic perfumes of the Belle époque. It is had to believe this perfume came out in 1992. It feel this perfume has been around for a century and will never get old. I live in Canada and have not been able to find in here. Thank you for keeping it available on your website.,5
1666,"Thank you for offering Sublime. It is so hard to find. I've been using Sublime since it first came out. It is about thje only perfume that doesn't give me a headache. I love the fragrance and often get compliments, with women asking me the name of the perfume I am ""wearing"". I live in San Diego and first found Sublime in Tijuana and had to keep going there to buy it, as the San Diego dept. stores did not (and still don't) carry it. It is the BEST fragrance ever!",5
1666,What can I say...I like the way I smell when wearing this. ,4
1667,"Very smooth, subtle type. Cleanliness and definitely not overpowering. This cologne says, I am the frame, the person wearing me is the main attraction. Just wish it would last longer. It lingers for about 5 hours or so.",4
1668,"Good smelling perfume, wish it lasted longer.",3
1668,"Trussardi Dona is one of the most beautiful fragrances ever created. Sweet, elegant and stylish, it is a perfect day perfume. ",5
1668,"Amazing, Feminine fragrance which starts off very clean and citrusy. Its very distinct and not like anything I have smelled before. After a bit of time you smell the floral, jasmine notes. And later once its worn off a bit, it smells soft and creamy, very sweet and vanilla sandalwood - this is the smell that lingers the longest.. Its amazing how the smell transforms so much as it wears off - a very complex smell in a good way. A very womanly smell. The signature fragrance of Priyanka Chopra which is the ONLY reason I bought this perfume without even testing it out. You won't be disappointed - this is amazing!",5
1670,I love Very Sexy For Him 2. It’s the best cologne out there. Smells great. Would recommend 100%! ,5

1674," I am a heterosexual woman and I love Ambre for myself and for men. IF you find another female fragrance that mixes well with Ambre, you can mix the two and come up with your own perfume. Use your creativity and imagination. AMBRE smells like fine amber oil and other wonderful scents. It is totally unique, elegant and intoxicating. IF I met a man who wore Ambre, I would say ""wow, that man smells great!!"" I highly recommend this fragrance for men who are chivalrous, creative, artistic, wealthy and unique. ",5

A little was sprayed on me and I wore it as I shopped. The fragrance did not give me a headache and did not become so overpowering as to make me sick at my stomach. I decided to buy it. That was three years ago and I have worn it since. Love the subtle aroma.,5

1678,I purchased Enigma Essence Mist by Adam demarkoff recently. She is 91 years old and has enjoyed this product for many years. She was thrilled that this was still available. She has probably been using it since 1972!! So I guess that tells you her opinion of the product ,5
1679,Escada Sentiment is a very classic men perfume with a good aroma. And I like it. I was looking for the original Escada men frangance that was with a more intense aroma but it is not available. Good purchase. ,3

1680,"I've only started using Michael Jordan flight sport since about 2016 or 2017, but it has quickly become a favorite. There is the Flight cologne and there's the Flight Sport, they both have similar scents but a noticeable difference to those with keen sense of smell. Great cologne. ",5

1682,"Signorina Eleganza!- So beautiful!!!! Feminine, delicate sweet. I love it!!!",5
1682,"Signorina Eleganza. Similar to the level of Coco mademoiselle, La vie est belle and paloma picasso Not the typical fruity. You will smell the base of soft patchouli more. Very well done composition This is worth splurging for. I am not a fan of the original signorina but this is more like a signora fragrance. Absolutely incredible. Enjoy",5
1682,Signorina by Salvatore Ferragano butifull sent ,5

1683,"Subtil was a blind buy but was encouraged by the ""good reviews"" on it. I decided to try it and was disappointment. Longevity is horrible and the smell is so generic. The dry down smells a bit better but not enough to wear it more than once. I guess people have different taste in how something smells. ",1
1683,"It is not a great perfume, but is Féragamo, I dont buy another one Aqua the Gio is the one...",1
1683,Love the scent. So fresh to wear..,5

1684,I did not think this one would smell very feminine judging by it`s name but it did. It smelled even better the longer I had it on. ,4
1685,"First time I inhaled Tabac, this was in the early 70's. My boss was wearing it. It is a very romantic fragrance, and addicting. At the time it was introduced it was in the drug stores. This is where the good, expensive fragrances came from. I love it!! ",5
1685,Tabac Aftershave- classic but not dated. Leaves you smelling clean & manly. Love this stuff can't shave without it!,5
1686,Please bring back Tabu dusting powder. Dana rules! ,5

1689,"I've been collecting perfumes for years, and had never seen Vera Wang Look in retail stores even once. I'm so glad I found it here online! Look is one of my new favorites....it starts out fresh, fruity, and vibrant, and slowly dries down to a softer musky scent that lasts for hours. I get 8+ plus hours of wear with just 2 sprays. This would work well in the office, but I would recommend spraying at least 30 minutes before work so it can dry down to the softer base. Also thinking that this works best in spring and summer. GOOD STUFF! ",5
1689,"I love this fragrance I thought they had stopped making it, I wish there was a lotion to go with it ",5
1689,I bought very Wang look after reading the reviews and have been in love ever sense. It reminds me of a more intense version of clinique happy. Can be worn by anyone at anytime of day,5

Oh and LOOK will get you the attention for sure! :)",5

1692,"4711 fragrance towelettes are a fantastic find! The fragrance is a great clean, fresh classic citrus that calms down into a nice fresh scent that is never too strong. The towelettes are especially great for traveling as you don’t have to worry about leaky bottles ruining your clothes. I live in a warm climate and love to keep them in my purse to freshen up with when I’m feeling wilted. Great for a gym bag too. You really can’t go wrong with these!",5
1693,Banana Republic Rosewood. I blind bought this perfume because of the reviews and because I have been wearing BR Wonan and I thought about giving Rosewood a chance and I am in love with this scent. It smells amazing.

1693,I absolutely LOVE this perfume. Every time I wear it women compliment me on it and ask where I purchased it. One woman even said that it is a scent that men will love. I am so sad that it is sold out at the moment but hope that it will be back soon. This is one of the few that smells good with my body chemistry. I definitely recommend this to anyone.,5
1693,This is the only perfume I have ever worn where strangers stop me and ask me the scent. I keep the travel size in my purse to refresh during the day. This is an amazing scent that is not overpowering! I love it....and apparently so does everyone else! ,5

1696,Have worn this for yrs and get compliments everytime. Very sexy.,5
1697,"I bought this based on the description of the perfume, and I was not disappointed. I reach for this more often than not, the sweet floral tones are perfectly balanced by the musky tones, then the top notes of lavender and shisho come in beautifully to add a clean fresh element. If that were not enough violet and tea note blend sensually to a divine finish. Bvlgari has a unique way of making perfume a truly delightful experience, don't miss out on this one. Also if you are looking for a sophisticated evening scent that lasts and lasts Bvlgari Jasmine Noir is perfect for you.",5
1697,Eau de Bleu smells great. Good for Fall time.,5
1697,a cologne that last the entire 24 hour.....,5
1697,"I was totally bummed that I am unable to find my longtime favorite BVLGARI Blanc been wearing it for over 10 years but this new absolutely fresh, gorgeously musky and never to sweet or strong, has already made my favorite list.

I'm sure the new scent is lovely, but I am wanting to know if the new edition smells the same. Thank you so very much. ",5
1698,"Byzance de Rochas is an incense-heavy floriental that launched in 1987. It is very much a product of its day- it is big and potent! It’s been reformulated a few times, but the keynotes are still there. It’s just lost a bit of it’s complexity, along with its original, striking bottle. Byzance would never be mistaken for anything else, which is a very good thing. A daring man could wear this fairly easily. ",4
1698,"This was the first perfume my mother bought for me decades ago. I've searched for this for years, I'm so glad I've found it. Please keep it in stock. Tamera S.",5
1698,"I have used Byzance for over 25 years and was on my last bottle when it was made available again. Over the years, I have received many compliments with, ""What are you wearing? You smell so good!"" .Thank you Rochas and FragranceNet. ",5

1700,I have worn the original Estee by Estee Lauder Pure frangrance spray since my parents gave it to me on my 16th birthday. That was over 44 years ago. Was extremely sad when they got rid of the pure. Hopefully they will change their minds and bring it back someday. Hopefully before my final two bottles are gone. ,4
1700,"I started wearing Estee Super Cologne Spray back in the 70's. It became my signature scent. I loved it! Men used to follow me down the street to ask me what perfume I was wearing. I was very unhappy when they stopped making it. Glad to see it is back. I hope it still smell the same. I have purchased the new one but haven't used it yet. It is a small bottle and so costly, I'm afraid that I will use it all up and have difficulty finding it again. ",5
1700,"Would love the old version,lstill have the bottle but I didn’t want to spend $250 for it. I hope you bring it back at a reasonable price Marge in Colorado ESTEE Super Cologne Spray 1.85 ozLIQ/55ml back in 50 & 60’s ",5
1700,"I also have been wearing Estee for at least 40 years. Used to buy it in quantity at the Base or Post Exchanges, but it is not available any more. Started searching for it in stores and on line for a while,, but pricing was so unreal that I stopped looking. Now I see at least the Super Cologne Spray Vaporizer is at least available and I am extremely happy. I wish Estee Lauder would reconsider the other elements that used to be in the Line of Estee to bring back. I am sure selling them would not be a problem. I love the scent and the product and hope to enjoy it for many more years. Thank you Estee.",5
1700, I used the Estee Pure fragrance for years and it stayed on all day yet was a very mellow fragrance. The new Estee does not stay on and I was very disappointed and it cost more. I have just moved on but still miss my beloved Estee Pure Fragrance!. Sure wish they would reconsider producing it again. They would make a lot of us women happy!,1
1703,"Judith leiber night is a beautiful, sexy fragrance that I took a chance. One of the best blind buys that no review guided me to. This fragrance is so underrated. I'm glad I took a chance. Great for nights out in fall and winter. ",5

1703,"Night by Judith Lieber is my new obsession :-) It was time for a new fragrance, especially for the fall/winter. I stumbled across this scent in the mysterious black bottle with jewels not knowing what to expect. On me, it smells CLEAN and inviting in a unique and delightful way. Over time, the more spicy and warm parts of this fragrance come alive in a comforting, approachable, long lasting way. SO glad I found this! I wear it for any occasion. I even wear this just for myself, spritzing some on before bed. Mmmmmm. :-) I rate this 5 stars!!!",5
1703,enjoy this fragrance in limited wear/use - not something that I'd make my every day go to fragrance but when the mood strikes It'd be appropriate.,4
1704,I was devastated they discontinued it I only have 3 perfumes I can wear it and Juicy Couture is 1 of those 3 I love the smell and its not overbearing on my sinuses,5
1704,Wonderful scent. Wish they hadn't discontinued it. ,5
1706,"I never really found a go-to scent I enjoyed chrome azzaro, Kenneth Cole black, I do like more citrusy fruit smelling scents... finding this spray got me out of the world of body deodorant sprays. I am a heavy smoker too so it pays to have something stronger I am purchasing my 3 bottle right now. This is my daily spray and I have Armani code colonia for special occasions :) I love this site because It has everything and you can find testers also for most of the popular scents before spending the money... as far as its moneys worth.... if you like citrusy notes i get about a full 3-4 hours of full scent with top notes then it starts to fade so I'd say 6 hour max but I had to read up on how and where to apply the spray properly.",5
1706,Marc Ecko Unlimited: The Exhibit is a warm refreshing fragrance that I truly enjoy. It's great long lasting scent Carrie's you through the entire day. ,5
1706,It has a soapy smell but a good casual just hanging out with your girlfriend. But not your buddies. Nope a little to sweet for the guy's. But it has a all around mild clean fresh smell. Which helps when your close.,5
1707,"Modern Muse Chic is filled with white flower notes like the original Modern Muse. However, Chic is more youthful and flirty. Modern Muse is the more sophisticated woman, while MM chic is her vivacious younger sister. Chic is more fruity and somewhat stronger. Very nice perfume. It is sweet and ideal for younger Estee fans, but it is still very elegant and sophisticated.",5
1707,Modern muse chic is the best fragrance for daytime use. It has a gorgeus scent. Love it. Thank you fragrancenet ,5
1707,"I have bought this perfume at duty free, a little cheaper and yes it smells so refreshing and soft. Not too heavy so I will recomend it for any occasion at any time of day. Xx",5

1711,Good stuff for the price ,5
1711,TRIED THIS FRAGRANCE AND THE COOL CRISP SCENT DOES WONDERS IN A CROWD...RELAXING AND REFRESHING...THIS PERRY ELLIS MAN LOVES IT!! AND I GOT COMPLIMENTS OF HOW FRESH IT IS!!,4
1712,"For the ridiculously low price, you won’t find a better performing/quality fragrance. This is a woody, lightly spiced, and very uplifting cologne. So nice!",5
1712,"I have always admired the clean, fresh scent of Quorum original cologne. I recently purchased this product and received it on 3/2/2016. I was pleasantly surprised by its clean, fresh scent of pine and lemon. It has a very crisp, just out of the shower waft that is sure to capture the attention of anyone around! I would recommend the use of this cologne any time of the day, as it has a multifunctional scent that is appropriate for whatever use one has in mind! I give it a 5 star review!",5
1712,I used QUORUM since it came out and switched to QUORUM Silver when it was introduced. I have gotten many complements on the casual smell!,5
1713,"Extremely sexy. Elizabeth Arden makes very nice perfume. You won't regret this purchase. Love it, when I'm wearing it my coworker is all over me wanting to know the name of my perfume.",5
1713,Red Door Aura by Elizabeth Arden is absolutely beautiful! My mom and I have been using it for years now. It’s as alluring as it’s relatively affordable. My best casual perfume. Love it!,5
1713,"Red door Aura is fantastic. After reading all the positive feedback,I can definitely understand why some people would prefer this one over the original. Nothing personal against anyone who wears Red Door if you're comfortable with that one,however,take note that some of us can't afford the best of the best and so,there's always another alternative. I'm glad I bought this instead and I'm loving it. ",5
1713,"Excellent fragrance!!!..... I may sound biased here but I so wished the people at Elizabeth Arden & co. would banish the original Red door forever & keep this one in stock. I just HATE that strong scent on any woman,it's like it permeates on their clothes and leaves a very heavy trail suffocating any and every person in their midst!! But Red door aura,ohh,I absolutely do not mind at all. It's very soft and pleasant,more balanced than the original but still feminine and reasonably priced too. This is coming from an older guy by the way. Definitely putting this one on my Christmas list for the ladies in my life.",5
1713,"This fragrance is way too beautiful for words. While doing my early Christmas shopping,I sampled this from a newly opened fragrance boutique at the mall. I don't know what the heck happened to me that day but I felt pretty & a boost of self confidence. I thought to myself,this will be my Christmas gift this year,so I immediately went back & bought four bottles of Red Door Aura,some gift wrapping paper and bows as well as a bottle each of two other faves,Splendor & Fifth Avenue. Some thought I was crazy but I left that mall a very happy & satisfied customer. Thank you Elizabeth Arden for making my Christmas the happiest one ever!!!",5
1714,Ricci Ricci is one of my wife's favorite fragrances. Need I say more...?,4
1714,This is the frist ever perfume I wear and since then I fell in love with it. This smells unique and everyone compliments me whenever I am wearing this. This lasts so long. I sprayed it in the morning and I can still smell it till I go to bed. Run out of two bottles and I am getting a third bottle. Love this so much. ,5
1714,The items ordered were a gift as far as I know they were satisfied Cuba variety and ricci ricci,5
1714,"I am a long-time fan of Nina Ricci fragrances. My first fave as a teen was L 'Air du Temps. Later I discovered Farouche as my fave, and it was discontinued. This year, I took a chance with a Ricci Ricci sample. I am so pleased to have another favorite. The combination of notes match my chemistry very well. As it blooms, I enjoy the hint of the tuberose. Hoping others discover and like it as much as I. Getting the larger bottle, for sure.",5
1714,"I bought this perfume without trying it first, guided by opinions online and I don't regret it, it's different from everything I have, a delicious, rich smell that lasts all day. Just the right amount of sweetness. A must have fragrance. Love the rhubarb note. So different! ",5
1715,"Another good fragrance from Cartier, Roadter starts woody/vanilla scent but with time the lavender and patchouli shows and a pleasant sophisticated fragrance take over. A very good man cologne.",4
1715,"Cartier - Roadster A true Classic, It has such a variety of blend, it can be worn by the most sophisticated, to the sports figure, to the most macho. The one thing it relays, perfectly is MAN. So many men need to know about this. Go get em girls. ",5

1719,My new favorite scent! I will buy more before I run out of product!,5
1719,I've been using Mugler's Alien products for over 5 yrs. Fragrance Net has the absolutely BETS price on it around. Thankd so much for saving me money! I can buy 3 for the price of 2 anywhere else. ,5

1719,My lastest signature fragrance!,5
1720,"I wanted my father to try a new cologne for Fathers Day, so I got a couple samples of Angel Men Pure Shot. I figured if he didn't like it - no loss. Well, he loves this scent and has hinted, he would like to have a larger version.",5
1722,"Like the fragrance of Cabotine Gold. However, it doesn't linger as well as the regular Cabotine. ",3
1722,DO NOT LAST TO MUCH SMELL FADES AWAY,2
1722,"Nice fragrance for day or evening. Also, can be worn year 'round.",5
1722,Cabotine gold. I love it. I wasn't disappointed . Thank you. ,5
1723,"Charlie Red is the best I've ever found. This was mainly for an aunt who is expecting her second child pretty soon. I've noticed that certain strong scents trigger her morning sickness so I thought maybe this might help. She loved it and yes,she did not get any bad reactions after wearing it a couple of times to her doctor's appointments and a few outings with my uncle. Even my little cousin loves snuggling up on her so this was an excellent purchase.",5
1723,I always buy from FragranceNet..The Quality is Good and you can't beat the prices...I would highly recommend buying from them!! ,5
1723,Nice and soft. Love it,5

1726,"full & opulent, nice base. perfect for evenings in Vegas",4
1726,I just fell in love with Gucci Premmiere... It is both classy and delicate,4
1726,Gucci premiere eau de toillete is all about the jasmine and a bit of citrus. Pretty and sexy at the same time. Would make a great signiture scent. ,4
1727,"Hugo XY is a great spring / summer fragrance. I get many compliments of fresh, fruit, and clean. I brought it from this site, and it is authentic. Great price and i used the whole bottle, so now it's time to buy another. Great for young and old. I compare it to Nautica, Burburry Touch, but with pear in it.",4
1729,Smells like Sea and Ski!!! Love this summer fragrance !,5
1729,Personally I think all of Jennifer anistons perfumes and body sprays are most excellent,5
1729,I haven't tried it yet. But I would love to try it.,3
1730,"I fell in love with Jovan's black musk a few months ago when I was at a friend's wedding anniversary party & it was actually her ninety year old mother in law that was wearing it. It smelled fantastic on her and when I asked her about it,she was more than happy to tell me. I just had to buy mine immediately and I'm so glad I did. Such a soft gentle fragrance and not overpowering at all. Even great for all those suffering with allergies or sinus problems. Try it,and see if you'll agree.",5
1730,"Love Jovan black musk. I found the deodorant spray and it left a very subtle but gentle scent on my skin but I combined both along with some cocoa butter lotion and voila! I feel beautifully sensual & sexy in a great way, and everyone I meet always wants a big hug. They just can't get enough of my own personal delicious combo. Try some for yourself. ",5

1730,"I am very cautious when it comes to selecting certain fragrances. I have very bad allergies and sometimes serious asthma attacks that I'm almost afraid to even try any,until I was told about Jovan's black musk. Absolutely beautiful and gentle fragrance,without any symptoms. Everyone I meet just love it and are eager to buy some for their significant others. Very satisfied with this one. Buying more pretty soon. ",5
1730,Have really been a musk user and the black is the best of them all!,5
1731,Just super. You will not be disappointed,5
1731,I LIKE IT ITS GREAT,5
1731,It will surprise you! Long lasting fragance,5
1732,"Very nice top notes. As are all fragrances by Guerlain,very long lasting. A little too sweet for my taste. If you enjoy Shalimar,this would make a lovely evening fragrance, or even a daytime,winter fragrance. La Petit Robe Noire is a lighter fragrance than I expected from the description. I would recommend buying the sample,it may be your cup of tea.",5
1733,I love Lolita Lempicka Sweet perfume. It's fruity and feminine with a kick. I love it and get a good deal of compliments each time I wear it.,5
1733,I love it. One of my favorite perfumes. Soft and sweet smell. I would highly recommend it ,5
1733,"Smells great initially, very sweet candy like, sexy, young, flirty but doesn't last long maybe 1 hour. ",1
1733,"This Lolita Sweet is sweet, some what delicate, with a candy like fragrance, also this would probably be more suitable for a younger crowd. Although I'm not very young myself, I have no regrets about this purchase, and I give it five ★ ★ ★ ★ ★!! ",1
1733,"Sweet by Lolita Lempicka is a beautifully fresh, sweet and spicy parfume! I love it. It's soft yet spicy. Hints of apple, caramel and the original Lolita Lempicka scents.",1

1735,This is my favorite perfume for daily wear. I get complements every time I wear it. I love this fragrance. Thanks Katy Perry......don't ever stop manufacturing it. Tammy M.,5
1735,Honeslty i love the MAD potion it’s my favorite perfume ever I had the best deal too! I’m forsure gonna buy another one such a good price for a 3.4 oz! Love it ! ,5
1735,"MAD, great subtle daytime wear.",4
1735,Smells nice weak scent but good performance my lady loves it.....has to over spray for effect,3

1736,Wonderful Mercedes Benz flower fragrance! ,5

1737,Siren lasts all day and the smell is not overpowering. I really do love this one and I get so many compliments and wool ware shock when they see how affordable it is!,5
1737,I really like siren by Paris Hilton. I purchased the roll on travel size. Perfect for your purse. ,4
1737,siren is wonderful perfect for any real woman ,4
1737,I love Siren fragrance I've been wearing it for several years. Because of my allergies this is a perfect perfume for me.,5
1738,Prada candy gloss was a great purchase. Loving the prada kiss ligns!!,5
1738,Prada Candy is my favorite of all perfumes. Ordered two for my granddaughter. Because it's light and sweet. Please note it was discontinued in Macy's.,5
1738,"In love with the smell, and price I got the largest one for! ",5
1738,"This is my new favorite perfume. It smells soft and sweet, just like candy, my boyfriend loves it!",5
1739,"Pure White Linen is a spritely, uplifting fragrance that has fruity floral notes combined with light-as-air green floral notes. Overall, a sparkling scent that is well suited for spring/summer. I personally prefer White Linen because it is a refreshing, crisp, clean fragrance with mossy notes. It is warm and far most long lasting than PWL. ",4
1739,"Pure White Linen by Estee Lauder has been my ONLY fragrance for several years now. I love it and am complements often about how I smell! I use it each morning after dressing for the day. I feel it is still present on me in the evenings. It really is ""beyond perfection""! Sue Tidwell",5
1739,"Absolutely Love, love Estée Lauder Fragrances , Especially Pure White Linen, It's about the nicest one I have had so far And I have used many of her perfumes, It has a beautiful light scent, not too strong ! In fact I have just purchased a new one. Can't beat Estée Lauder products, Love them!!!!!! ",5
1739,Estée Lauder's pure white linen is one of my favourites of all time ,5
1739,"Pure White Linen is beyond perfection. I am so thrilled to have purchased this gorgeous fragrance for my best friend's upcoming wedding. I probably should have brought Beautiful but even though I like that one,she's going to be wearing it since it's her special day & I'd like nothing more than to see her happy. Soft,sexy and romantic is my description for this one. No one does it better than Estee Lauder.",5
1740,"Nice scent. Roberto, I am with you on the Uomo scent. Smells a little familiar with its fresh floral scent with a hint of darkness. I also like the longevity. ",4
1740,"This is an underrated house for sure! Roberto Cavalli has done a great job with this fragrance - a great start! Sharp opening which quickly dries down into floral and honey with a backdrop of tonka and vanilla. Very masculine fragrance. I don't usually like powdery scents, but this one doesn't bother me at all. The floral is more masculine and the honey ties it all together. Definitely winter, fall and spring. Special evening events. Not sure I would wear this to the office. I really enjoy this one.",5
1741,"Just received my Serge Lutens Feminite Du Bois and it's amazing! Smells the same as Shiseido Feminite Du Bois and I am so glad that i found it here for a better value. Very different, exquisite perfume. I'll be back for more! ",5
1741,Serge Lutens Feminite Du Bois: has NO staying power. It's the unique and intriguing fragrance I was craving; but unfortunately it has NO STAYING POWER! ,2
1741,I have used this scent since when it was marketed under Shisheido. It is slightly different now but still absolutely sensational. I highly recommend this woodsy magical and rare scent :),5
1741,love this fragrance. even more when I wore the sheseido brand for years until it was discontinued. love the subtlety of it. always got compliments. don't smell this scent often on others. recently bought the serge Lutens version. I have a little of the original to compare. there's only a slight difference. this hasn't become my signature scent like it was a while back but I still like it a lot. ,5
1741,"Warm & exotic but not overpowering. I've only read stories of old Havana,Cuba but feel this is a scent that would be present in the nightclubs there. Mysterious but familiar. ",5
1742,"I love this fragrance. Very soft, clean, powdery scent...I identify the lily of the valley...so pretty. Out of all the samples of the various Symetrie fragrances, Balance is my favorite. ",5
1742,I like this perfume ,5
1742,Symétrie Balance is simply the most exquisite perfume available right now. I haven't fallen in love with a fragrance as badly as I am with this since D&G Sicily. Perfect all day long and lasts more than 24 hours. ,5
1742,I love this scent it's soft and last all day now I have to get the other five,5
1742,"Semetrie Balance eau de parfum! Absolutely love this fragrance, the scent is very fresh. Good at any time day or night. One of my favorites.",4
1743,Happy with price product great.,5
1743,Dolce body lotion is a very good product,5
1743,love this scent. the lotion is a perfect compliment to the perfume. Little lotion and then the perfume helps to keep the scent subtley active all day. ,5
1743,"The One is wonderfull, i feel special when i wear it...it. Smells devine",5
1744,"Pretty & sweet very nice reccommended,for everyone. ",5
1745,"Vince Camino Oud is simply a beautiful take on a designer Oud fragrance. The smell is in the same realm as your M7's, Oud Wood, or Versace Oud Noir, fragrance's like that but with Vince's own take on a designer Oud. Great for evening wear or fall time. Sexy, sophisticated, masculine, but light and elegant performance for a subtle but definitely noticeable oud smell. For performance on my skin, I typically get around 6 to 8 hrs solid, with maybe 2 hrs of projection. Close encounter type of sillage, not monstrous but ppl will notice when you walk pass. I will keep this one in my collection. Love the smell! ",4
1748,"This has staying power. I purchased this based on several reviews that I read on line. I have never bought a fragrance without first trying it on. The spices in Amouage Epic just drive me crazy. A list of scents that I love are 1000, Shalimar, Balenciaga, Sira des Indes, Habanita, Trouble, and Kelly Caleche. The latter which lingers the longest. Now I have Amouage Epic. There are no words to describe how I felt when I put this on. Let's just say I felt uninhibited. I woke up with the beauty of it still on my wrist. If you want to try something different and totally sexy, this is it. Truly worth every penny!",5
1748,people asking me what I am wearing....beautiful and elegant. very special,5
1748,"Beautiful fragrance, have received good comments from others when wearing this fragrance. One of my favourite amouage!!!",5
1750,"Armani is how I met my current spouse. It was so full of citrus, it blew the top of the bottle of Balmain! The wife would INSIST I wear it before we went out for an evening. Must have brought back those memories from 42 years ago. The scent has changed due to body chemistry, but the ""stuff"" works so well, sometimes she has to pull other females away! R3MAR",5
1750,I have been using this cologne for more than 20 years. I love it very much. ,5
1750,"classic, refreshing. very natural scent.",5
1750,"As advertised, this is the real thing. Also, as advertised it is quite SMALL (look at the photo carefully)",4
1750,In my humble opinion ARMANI is a excellent fragrance which I have enjoyed for years. I elated that I can still purchase it on your site! Thank you so much for have this cologne as well as many others I enjoy! ,4
1751,We have bought from here for a couple of years now and have always gotten speedy delivery and the product is always exactly what the description says it is. plus we have gotten great deals. we also found that this is the only place that we could find that still carried the British sterling soup that we give to my father who loves it for Christmas every year. we got such a great deal on them that we purchased four bars. ,5
1752,"Bvlgari Goldea Roman Night I love this scent, unfortunatly it doesn't last on me. I should have sampled it first. When someone complains about a scent not lasting its no ones fault. We need to try it before. All of the other Blvgari fragrances I have all last. Just not this one. I will give it to a friend.. Id give it a 5 if it lasted because it smells great",3
1752,This is a very thick rich scent. I bought this one for my mom and she loves it. I do not know how another reviewer said that this is a light scent as it is clearly not. I would say it is similar to Narcisco Rodriguez For Her. ,5
1752,"This is nice but extremely extremely light. You will most appreciate it after dry down. Great for people with allergies. If you love strong long lasting scents, you will not appreciate this one. If you are sensitive to scents, this may be the scent for you. ",4
1752,"I think it is ""DELICIOUS""",5
1753,"The Chaz made today the scent doesn't last as long as the one made years ago, which lasted an entire day The scent made today lasts maybe 2 or 3 hours.",3
1753,My husband loves this cologne as an every day scent to where. It's highly recommended especially for the price!,5
1753,The smell didn't last like it did 20 yrs ago. Chaz use to be one of my favorites.,1
1753,This cologne is designed to wear anytime for all occasions and the price is plus . Thank ,1
1754,Great fragrance for a mature man. Quite punchy (in a good way) and long lasting. A very elegant fragrance that will have compliments pouring in. ,4
1754,Got a really nice compliment from someone I was absolutely trying to impress. I am wearing the cologne again and again as long as my eyes are focused on this little honey.,5
1754,Great cologne. Always loved the scent since I would steal a few sprays from my older brothers Collection. Definitely has that grown man smell. I get compliments when I give ppl hugs ppl smell it on my neck.,5
1754,Great Fragrance. 100% genuine. Will definitely buy again and again..,5
1754,Cartier Declaration Essence is one of the best perfumes for a gentle man. I recommend this for someone who needs a strong and long lasting signature. This product is 100% genuine.,5
1755,"This gift set from Ed Hardy by Christian Audigier is a must have for any Ed Hardy fan!! It smells amazing and the fragrance actually lasts!! I get an allergic reaction to most fragranced body washes like this, but I didn’t get any reaction from this one!! An absolute must have for any Ed Hardy fan!! And the price is amazing, too!!",5
1755,A must have in my closet!! The Ed Hardy gift set by by Christian Audigier smells fresh and very fruity. And is a sure treat for anyone who wears it. I never want to run out of it!!!,5
1756,Good scent would recommend it!!!,4
1756,"Got a Gentlemen only Absolute for Valentines and was extremely surprised how wonderful it smells on my skin. It's very intriguing how it makes me feel energized & ready to get out for a classy evening. At first it's smells similar to Spice Bomb, dry down simila to Paco Rabanne 1 million absolute but softer & gentler enough to draw compliments. . This fragrance smells so nice & lasts for at least 5 hrs. ",5
1756,"Surprisingly good! Reminds me of Spice Bomb from the initial spray, but changes after that. A nice warm and spicy scent with just enough ""umph"" to carry the scent in cooler weather, but not too ""in your face"" strong that'll choke you or those around you out. 2-3 sprays are more than enough to carry you through the day (at least on my skin). ",5
1756,The Givenchy Absolute is a very strong scent . You are more than likely to turn heads when you walk in the room . It's a lady catcher ,5
1757,"Ordered it several weeks ago, still waiting for it.",5
1757,"Just had a big ""scent memory"" moment with Havana that I would like to share : ). I've been using Havana for a couple of weeks now and it has had a familiarity that I just couldn't pinpoint until now. Have you noticed all of the posts on this scent referring to a soapy dry down smell . . . ever used Dial Gold soap? If you have and still have a bar, spray a wrist with Havana and give it a few minutes to dry down and then sniff it and then the gold Dial. Pretty close, huh?! Loved Dial Gold while growing up and in my opinion, there is no cleaner, longer lasting ""old school"" smelling soap and Aramis Havana shares the same scent profile, but even smells twice as good as the soap because it must use higher quality ingredients. Now I can spray on a higher quality version onto my skin anytime and get that same spicy soap freshness! I think it's notes of cinnamon, patchouli, orange, oakmoss, and vetiver that are most responsible for the smell. I am definitely going to get a lot of use from Havana and what a bargain it is! Following are two quotes that explain why sent is linked to memory: "" Smell and Memory. The sense of smell is closely linked with memory, probably more so than any of our other senses. Those with full olfactory function may be able to think of smells that evoke particular memories; the scent of an orchard in blossom conjuring up recollections of a childhood picnic, for example"" - from Psychology and Smell - Fifth Sense ""One reason this might be has to do with the way your brain processes odors and memories. Smells get routed through your olfactory bulb, which the smell-analyzing region in your brain. It's closely connected to your amygdala and hippocampus, brain regions that handle memory and emotion"" - from Why Sense of Smells Can Trigger Strong Memories - Dr. Mercola",5
1757,"Havana is sharp, sexy and seductive. As good if not better than the classic original Aramis.",5
1757,"i am very pleased to have this product back in my collection. i have one of the original bottles with about 1/3 left. it is such a great scent. and these folks did a good job with our order, so we give them kudos. thanks",5
1757,"Bought Havana,by Aramis as gift for my husband . The minute it arrived he sprayed himself and everything else in the room . Very pleasant to my surprise. He simply loves it . And so. Do I... ",1
1758,"Guerlain Heritage EDT is for the grown, confident, and gentile. A warm, woody composition that makes me hard-pressed to imagine anyone not finding unique and pleasant.",5
1758,Another classic from Guerlain. I've worn it from the day it was released. I constantly get stopped by people (both men and women) wanting to know what I'm wearing that smells so good.,5
1758,Guerin Heritage: Smells like a $3 bottle of Old Spice from the 70's!,1
1758,"My favorite compliment is ""you smell so good"" and I hear those words often since wearing this for the last few years. I'm a 50+ woman and adore this fresh, citrus-y, delicious fragrance. I can't abide the overly saturated floral scents we ladies are ""supposed"" to wear. I encourage everyone looking for a clean, light fragrance to enjoy Heritage and all the compliments that will follow! ",5
1758,"Guerlain's Heritage is my favorite male fragrance (women who've admired it on me also wear it, as well) for any time of day and any occasion, casual or dressy.",5
1759,The eau de parfum is very different to the original eaude toilette . I had both and much prefer the Parfum because the almond woody toilette nauseates me. The parfum is stronger but delicious and morphs into a gentle plummy vanilla. They should have named it differently because they are. I actually find the Poison Girl much closer to the Toilette after the initial citrusy blast . It settles into the original Hypnotic. So if you don't like the Parfum version then try Poison Girl but don't be put off by the first spray . Otherwise stick to the original Toilette. I still love the Parfum it's rich and delicious .,5
1759,I feel thAt they have changed the formula. I’m going to buy this one more time. I’ve been buying hypnotic poison for over 18 years and was disappointed at the change. 1 more time to be sure or never again,5
1759,First time buying this parfume... I love strong fragrances that last all day. You can't go wrong with this purchase. Huge fan of la vie est belle too... Both are a winner. ,4
1759,"Just purchased EDP. This is my 3rd bottle in 14 yrs and it smells so different than the originals I've had and not in a good way. I am sooooo disappointed I really loved the perfume and the scent I fell in love with is gone. Never am negative about things or do I usually participate in reviews but I just was so sad when I sprayed it on and was expecting that full,rich scent. Sorry Dior. ",2
1759,Dior 's Hypnotic Poison: Is a keeper of personal beauty in the airborne scent of this woodsy awesome fragrance. ,5
1760,I ordered Jay Z for my love because it smells so good and fresh cleaning ,5
1760,I love it just wish the bottle was bigger,5
1760,I purchased Jay-Z gold as a Christmas gift for my husband at a very great price. Delivered in a timely manner just before Christmas. My husband loved it and it smells awesome. I definitely recommend this cologne for men to you ladies out there looking for a gift,5

1763,"Karl Lagerfeld Bois De Vertiver is absolutely amazing ,love it.",5
1763,"Over time, it can have a kind of fresh smell...but it also can be a turn off because it has a heavy tobacco and smokey smell to me. I've only gotten one compliment while wearing it. It could be that the musk is very overpowering.",2
1763,Karl Lagerfeld Bois De Vetiver is a bomb! Lovely in smell and longevity. It's characteristics reminds me of Karl Lagerfeld Photo I used to wear back in the college.,5
1763,I bought this on the suggestion of Max Forti fragrance reviewer. This is a hidden gem. Reminds me of John Varvatos Pure. Blind buy worthy,4

1768,Really love it on my husband. Friend from Switzerland over here in NZ on holiday was wearing it ...oh la la. Now all our family is wearing it,5
1768,Roma is a very different type smelling cologne. It is a very fruity smell not like other types of cologne. I really like it. It is quiet but yet commands attention.,4
1769,I have always loved my Antonio Banderas Spirit perfume I also love the body lotion but can't find it on the sight thank you.,5
1769,Absolutely love this perfume it smells Amazing my all time favorite,5
1769,Spirit. I buy this every year for my granddaughter for her birthday and of course one for myself. We love it. ,5
1769,Woodsy and peppery. This is a fantastic winter scent. Has that sexy spice to it that works for women of all ages. I had a bottle of this like 9 years ago and recently got another one and it smells just how I remembered! 4 stars instead of 5 because the dry down is a bit powdery and it doesn’t last long on me. ,4
1769,i love this perfume. Thank you for having it. ,4
1771,"I have been using Glorious for years. Its a fresh, clean scent and I get many compliments on it.",5
1771,Glorious is a very good scent. I have been looking for it for some years. Now l have found it! It seems that the price has elevated because of the demand though. I hope I can get hold of a bigger bottle. ,5

IF YOU LOVE A PERFUME THAT EVERY ONE WILL ASK YOU WHAT YOU ARE WEARING THEM THIS IS THE ONE.",5
1774,Great smells like Creeds Original Santal,5
1774,"Armaf Club De Nuit I bought this thinking it was the intense version. Im new to fragrances and wanted to compare to my decant of creed aventus. But for the price i figured i would try it. Worse case i could pass it off to a friend. I was pleasantly surprised when i finally opened it. I could slightly smell the comparisons to 1 million, but it's less sweet and a little more laid back. I could (and will) wear this to work where 1 million would be too much for that setting. I own ysl la nuit de lhomme, versace eros, aqua di gio profumo, PR 1 million, Bvagari aqua amaro and JPG ultra man. So i dont have much to compare it with. Although i know this will definitely be in my rotation. Only lasts about 3 to 4 hours and then it pretty much becomes a skin sent. But for the price thats fine with me. I really like this and im looking forward to trying more from Armaf. ",4
1774,"Intense man is the poor man’s creed Aventus. Similar scent but not exactly the same. Creed is longer lasting, cleaner, crisper, smoother, and is a better smell with more notes. This though is a great alternative for those that don’t want to spend the money on creed or get a small decant of it. For what this sells for it’s a must to at least try it! ",4
1774,"Awesome scent, longevity is awesome, perfect everyday scent love it thanks to #CUBAKNOW",5
1774,"This cologne is amazing. My son has used this for over a year now. He always gets great compliments about his choice of cologne. I will continue to buy this cologne as long as it is available.! The scent is not overpowering but enhancing. Love, Love, Love it,",5
1775,"jean-------- the aromatics in black is not what I expected. It is lighter than the Aromatics in White. Maybe I thought it would be a heavy night fragrance. The Elixir has always been long lasting and sexy and I enjoy the Aromatics in White as a Springtime fragrance. Overall, these 3 are delightful. Thank you for my discounts. ",1
1775,"This is not a review I've worn Clinique Aromatic for 20yrs. This was my late husband's favorite. I want to know if the Clinique Black is as good as the Aromatics, everytime I wear the Clinique Aromatics, everyone says that's my signature. I can't smell it on myself but so many compliments. I'm gonna try a small Clinique Black, hope I'm not disappointed. ",5
1775,Fantastic fragrance would recommend it to my friend's ,5
1775,Aromatics in Black is long lasting and sophisticated. Just beautiful!,5
1775,"AROMATICS In BLACK... smells Heavenly! I have been a loyal user of Aromatics Elixir for over 30 years it is one of my very favorite perfumes! I am going to buy this for one of my friends, Amazing fragrance!",5

1779,"I had my daughter order this perfume for me a year ago. How did I live without it? I get SOOOOO many compliments on the fresh, clean smell I possess when I wear it! I got the bath oil, too. Like Brylcreme...""A little dab will do you""!!!! I love fragrances, and this one explains why!!!! Cartier, La Panthiere, ",5
1779,"Excellent,I loved,thank u so much ",5
1779,"Cartier' s La Panther Legere is my signature fragrance. I try to be "" unfaithful "" but always come back . To me it is a warm @ fresh fragrance . The description did'nt mention the gardenia @ tiare flower notes. My only complaint is to me it doesn't have longevity, but it is a beautiful fragrance.",5
1779,"I love this scent. The reaction that I continue to get is that it is light and fresh. I want to be able to smell my own perfume during the day, but I don't want others to have to endure that strong smell that some perfumes keep. It lasts all day, but doesn't overwhelm. Enjoy!",5
1780,Love them all great smells ,5
1782,Very elegant in some case generic scent to my nose.,5
1782,"Dunhill Icon Elite excellent buy. Will buy again. The scent is very, very elegant. ",5

1783,"Adrenaline by enrique iglesias,awesome fragrance highly recommend!",5
1783,Enrique Iglesia very good ,5
1783,"Enrique Iglesias - Adrenaline It is clear that this has been highly under-rated, but I think this actually one of the top 10 scents out there when it comes to men’s cologne. First off, it is long lasting and that is wonderful thing in my book. It is very balanced and very pleasant to the senses. Also it is very unique and distinct and I put it up there with Cool water, escape and polo red; I think it’s high caliber stuff. Awesome!",5
1783,"It smell so good, great for all man, specially if u looking to make a good impression on someone..",5
1784,Euphoria Blossom smells good and clean ,4
1784,Euphoria Blossom-is too light Smells like it is watered down. I'll go back to another Euphoria type next time I order,2

1784,I like the perfume very much. Euphoria Blossom.,2
1784,Love this perfume. Shopping at fragrancenet. is easy and they always have what I want. ,5
1785,I bought Hollister Wave because I had recently purchased Hollister Jake . Not knowing what it would smell like. I was surprised! Really nice smell not too strong! ,5
1786,"It is certainly a fact that Insurrection li Dark has be come a favorite fragrance of mine. Your site has a lot to offer. I will be ordering from you in the future for sure. Thanks, Ed moore",5

1788,Moschino Fresh Couture Love it. Usually wear Angel and this has that uniqueness to it. Lasts fairly well.,5
1788,MOschino gold love it. Worth it ,5
1789,It’s different not sure if I like it or not. Seems like it’s got a little punch to it. I have several of her perfumes. I thought I’d try it; I think it’s made for younger crowd.,3
1789,"I got this as a gift for Christmas last year, and I was a little skeptical, as I have found in the past that any fragrances with a celebrity's name tend to not be the best. However, in this case, I was wrong! This smells fantastic! I wear it everyday and get tons of compliments on it. I have gone through 2 entire bottles of it in 10 months, and just purchased a third. The price point is perfect as well. LOVE THIS!!!!!",5
1789,Paris Hilton's Gold Rush Rosee is a fantastic fragrance. It just invokes glamour. I'm not sure how long it lasts for though. Good delivery service. I was informed of the delivery time by the courier.,4
1791,Very Fresh an Clean ...love it ,5
1791,"Juliette Has a Gun has been my favorite perfume line for a few years now. My main fragrance choices are usually ‘Not A Perfume’ and sometimes ‘MMMM.’ All the JHAG perfumes are very individual and unusual. That’s what I love about this brand. But one scent, ‘Sunny Side Up,’ stands out from the others. I had several samples of it and loved them. Now, it’s time to splurge and buy my own bottle. It’s different because it is slightly more traditional than the others. It’s still a bit unusual, but the fragrance is uplifting, feminine, bright—not like the others. I like to wear Sunny Side Up for social events that may be more traditional, such as Southern weddings, certain business meetings, and visits with the in-laws. Sunny Side Up does not disappoint. It smells somewhat like ‘Good Girl’ by Carolina Herrera. Upbeat, uplifting, and perfect for any occasion. It’s individual, wears well for hours but still stays close to the body; but, the difference is that your Mom or aunt may like this fragrance as much as you do. And like the rest of the Juliet line, it is worth the high price. ",5
1792,"The One Gentleman by Dolce & Gabbana is for my son who has been wearing it for some years, this is the second time I have purchased it as its a hard fragrance to purchase in Australia.",5
1792,Dolce & Gabbana The One Gentleman is probably my all-time favorite fragrance. I've received more compliments wearing The One - Gentleman than anything else I wear. I hope they make it forever.,5
1792,"Dolce & Gabbana The One Gentleman is probably my all time favorite fragrance. It is a great, complex scent that wears well morning, noon, or night. I've often wondered why it never became more popular. I hope they never stop making it. I'll wear it until I die, and ask they have some to bury with me.",5
1792,I have heads turn my way & was like. Mmmm! You smell great!,5
1792,"The dolce & gobbana, “the one gentlemen” is my go to cologne. I’ve used this cologne for the last 4 years. I’ve had many different dolce brands but this one is still my favorite ",5
1793,"Very Unimpressed by the Versace Bright Crystal spray. Overpriced for something that is nothing that special, and doesn't last over 1 hr. ",1
1793,I absolutely love Versace Bright Crystal!! It has one of the most amazing scent. I will from now on order my fragrances from FragranceNet!! It's authentic and you cannot beat the prices. Next order I will order the larger bottle along with the large body lotion. Thank You!!!,5
1793,Versace Bright Crystal LOVE this fragrance... I get so many compliments when I wear it... just bought the shower gel & lotion when I use it my whole bathroom smells awesome!! great scent!!,5
1793,I have purchased the Versace Bright Crystal gift set a few times. The shower gel is delightful and not overpowering. The lotion even by itself is lovely and I use it often. The fragrance itself is now one of my very favorites and I am a perfume-aholic and have been since my early teens. I've recently purchased the small Bright Crystal Absolut thinking it is more potent. I've ordered a sample of the Versace Yellow Diamond to try and the small bottle of Versace Noir;?) to try as well. I am in the hospital a lot and always have my Bright Crystal lotion in my purse and receive so many compliments on how good my room smells! Overall this is probably my most favorite scent and for the price and packaging and longevity ( I put some on late yesterday afternoon and could still smell it today!) it is my most highly rated fragrance. ,5
1793,"I received a sample from Kohl's, this is the most heavenly fragrance that I have tried!! It is difficult to explain the origin of the fragrance or what I experience from the scent, to me it has the combination of all the above!!I I am a fragrance fanatic, and believe me I LOVE this ONE! Thank you for whom ever developed this one!!",5
1796,"I got for my 10 yr. old daughter. Perfect!!!! She loves it! And me too! It has very soft flowery sent like a rose but I would say like mixed with lavender + crispiness. Not overpowering but very, very pleasant. Great for any season especially for the summer 'cause of the hint of crispiness. I would say suitable for girls up to 18 yr. old. OR for any lady for a daytime use, not for the evening out though.",5
1797,"Aqua Quorum is a refreshing eau de toilette as Silver Quorum all perfumes from Antonio Puig(Puig) are fantastic, specialy Agua Brava and Lavanda Puig besides other bands that belongs to Puig like Paco Rabanne, Nina Ricci , Valentino an a few more ,",5
1797,"Nice fragrance, very similar to polo sport The only bad thing is that I received the box of the fragance open...",5
1798,Good formal scent. Good in the fall season....,4
1798,"I've purchased 2 bottles of BR Black Walnut. I'd categorize it as a classy gentleman's scent because it is masculine, elegant, and smells luxurious. It's a mature scent suitable for 25 years+. To me, cedar is the prominent note throughout, and it is a heavier, less playful cedar than the one found in Givenchy Pour Homme. It can be worn both day and night, with exceptions. It is appropriate for daytime events such as church and weddings, and also makes a great office scent for executives and for those in sales. If you wear it casually in the day, just use fewer sprays. In the evening, it is perfect for a night on the town, social event, or business dinner. Additionally, it does have a sensual side, so don't let it's professional, elegant side make you think it is all business. Lasts 4-6 hours on my skin, and becomes a skin scent within 3-4 hours. BTW, check out BR Classic (my favorite from BR) if you want a clean, fresh scent, and BR Wildblue Noir for a masculine, romantic, evening scent.",3
1798,"I have been buying this cologne for my husband for about 8 years, and it is one of the BEST, Elegant and sensual in the same time!! It brings the best out of what you're wearing and drew people towards you in a very settle and interesting way! I have bought 2 other different colognes for him, and every time he uses Black Walnut, I ask him which one you have on? It smells soo good! lol. However, every man's chemistry is different so like any other cologne it may be awesome on some but not all! ",5
1799,"I started to use Boucheron because it was Christmas gift. After it was finished I looked for it because it is so special . So ,I bought it and have always used for about 5 years now. The perfumes is classy and long lasting , the soap gel is a bath of good smell and cleanliness,and the after shave cream is fabulous. It lengthen the perfume smell in a very subtle effective way. Got to love it",5
1801,"Cuba Latino Variety, this is my second veriety I’ve ordered, love both of them. Great fragrance.",5
1801,"This set is a perfect collection of very masculine scents. Although all 4 are along a similar character, the subtle differences are quite unique & very aromatic. When I first used them I thought it smelled cheap, but as my body warmed the spices they began to release very exotic, intoxicating scents of amber, bergamot & cedar. I highly recommend this collection for any age man. It's a great way to give 4 gifts in 1.",5
1802,Ordered DKNY Be Tempted and it took about 7 days to arrive. Happy with purchase and shipping.,5

1803,"Éclat d' Fleurs, love this fragrance so feminine. Smells great I would recommend it. ",5
1807,"LOVE THIS!!!! I bought this for my dad who is a stroke survivor and the bottle has the small hole for dispensing so if he doesn't have a good grip and accidently drops it, we don't lose too much. Also, if he accidently puts too much in his hand it is such a nice subtle scent that I don't worry about him smelling too strongly.. So glad I tried the Joop Aftershave for him!",5
1807,Love the smell and women like it too.,5
1807,"Joop The wife likes it , so I'm good to go with it ",5
1807,"I bought this after shave JOOP for my husband. I just love the smell on him. I am asthmatic and it does not bother me. He likes the fact that he gets compliments when wears it. He needed to go to a sales call during a mini vacation so he took me along, while I sat in the reception area, the receptionist approached me and wanted to know what he was wearing because she really noticed it every time he came to their office, and if he was available. She apparently failed to notice his wedding band, but I smiled at her and told her that no he was available and that I was his wife and bought him the after shave, I told her the name of the after shave with a smile. She apologized and turned really red. I still laugh when I think about it. ",5
1808,Just got my sample in the mail. I loved that smell. I also got Bond 9 like that also. I will be reordering. Didn't get a chances to try the other purfume yet. I will be letting you know. ,4

1809,Love it like this product,5
1810,MIU MIU eau de Parfum Not good on my skin. For my daughter to say I smell like an old lady....is not the best of compliments. ;(,2
1810,"Miu Miu de parfume has a very like smell to it. It is very different from my other parfume.I love the scent. The only thing is it doesn't stay on long enough. I wish they had the lotion available, I would surely buy it.",5
1810,Miu Miu is one of the most intoxicating smells that I have indulged in lately. I’m a customer who loves clean seductive smells and this is it! My finance loves my original Parfume which is Fresh Laundry from the Clean Parfume. However when he smelled Miu Miu tester on me he said that we must purchase this parfume; while nuzzling in my neck ,5
1810,Excellent I loved it.,5
1810,"This is an intriguing fragrance. My daughter gave it to me for my birthday in June, and I was floored by its light but intoxicating smell.",5

1815,"I had no idea what this would smell like, but for the price I decided to try it because I like the bottle. I was pleasantly surprised to realize that not only is the bottle cute, but it smells good as well.",5
1815,"I bought 'Woodstock' being a fan of patchouli and I am a product of the pixies; when life was in transition, choatic, freeing, and mysterious. I am a devoted patchouli fan and will try any scent with it in its ingredients. This parfum is light enough to be worn around people (work) and not offensive, unless someone is allergic to the woodsiness of patchouli. This is a very relaxing fragrance and one you can wear after a shower and dressed for a comfortable afternoon watching tv, reading a book, or just coffee talk with friends. I am in a masters program and west this while I am doing school work. It can be worn year round, unlike some patchouli based scents which are best left to cooler months. You will not be sorry buying this perfume.",5
1815,"What a wonderful little inexpensive surprise!!!! This smells of sandalwood with the sweetness of jasmine. There is a little patchouli in it but it is a sweet not sharp scent. I can see being able to wear this to work, as it's sillage is not very far.",4
1815,"Rock n Roll Icon Woodstock '69 is a great perfume! It smells sweet to me in an outdoorsy way. Like jasmine and sandalwood mixed with amber. It's kind of addicting-- I just keep smelling it! To me this is a low-key casual perfume but I like bigger flowers like tuberose, so to someone else it may not be as gentle.",4
1816,"Terre d'hermes Eau Intense Vetiver out of the box distinguishes itself as a flanker that stands on it's own. This has some similarities to original, however, this scent has it's own unique scent and vibe. This could replace my signature scent, Terre d'hermes original. This has a little sweetness to it and still stands out from all the mass market worn scents. Dress up or down this is fantastic versatile juice. This is a man's scent, ALPHA!",5
1816,"This is a wonderful and radiant Vetiver. Initially a blast of Citrus but Vetiver is still present. A spicy peppery mid and a dry down that radiates Vetiver and florals. Very calming, alluring and potent. Last a long time on clothes and on my skin lasts longer than other scents. A good buy.",5
1816,"Terre d'Hermes - Vetiver is a fragrance that smells fantastic, very elegant yet bold!",5

1835,"Absolutely love! I have been getting this perfume for 5 years and everyone asks me what perfume am I wearing. It is unique, it's not overpowering and I can't believe the price. The only problem is I just received a new bottle and I think the manufacturer changed the scent. If that's the case I'm very dissatisfied with it. Please bring back the original Nichole Ritchie Perfume because it was outstanding and had a beautiful subtle yet powerful smell.",5
1835, Nicole by Nicole Richie is a different scent. It is oriental/Spicy/woodsy more spicy than anything. It is pretty strong at first but when it dries down it is actually pretty nice. You do not have to spray this too many times for others to smell it. It lasts too. (Definitely am your clothes),4
1835,Super stunning scent - I am so addicted to this Nicole perfume Love this one !!,5
1835,"Love this light, flowery, perfume! Always receive compliments about how nice I smell when I wear it. And it's not over-powering! You don't leave a trail of perfume, but when someone leans in to you, the scent is there. Love it. It's my go to, every day perfume.",5

I currently have about 47 different ones to choose from, by all means I have been using this one for about 6 years now and it's my favorite one. Every time I put it on, I get compliments from woman of all ages and even guys that I talk to ask me what's the name. This one is a must if you want to draw attention from a woman, believe me when I say it, I hope they keep making it........good luck!!!",5
1839,"360 white,wow,this perfume is really gorgeous. My chemistry seemed to have changed for the better because this one remained on my skin much longer than other fragrances I've used in the past. Enjoying it a lot as it's very versatile & for a great price too. ",5
1839,"Ah boy, good ol' Perry Ellis. Haven't used it in over twenty plus years but this 360 white is so amazing. I also like the purple one too. Many have asked me how I managed to find such lovely fragrances and I simply say; 'It's on Fragrance Net,look it up.' Two great findings to make my summer fun this year!!",5
1839,"I love it! It smells like ginger at first, then softens into this AWESOME soapy/ powdery scent. I love it. I found I do have to reapply after 4-5 hrs, but that's fine. I like spraying it! ",5
1839,"If one prefers a light scent not overpowering, then this is for you Perry Ellis 360 white. 360 white is a light fresh scent.",5
1839,"I was introduced to this Perry Ellis White fragrance by a lady from Trinidad who was staying at the same hotel we were in and it was the most sophisticated fragrance I've ever smelt. I had mistaken it for the original 360 but this is like the younger sister to it,only much lighter. The price is not bad either,even my mom and sisters love it. We're so going to stock up on this lovely fragrance as quickly as possible before they stop making it.",5
1840,"I know this product has been around for a while, however it is my all time favourite. I get so many comments about how great I smell and people ask what perfume/fragrance I'm wearing. I love layering the product with Pretty shower gel, body lotion and perfume. Pretty smells so good and is never over powering. I am disappointed as I think it will be discontinued soon and I'll have to find another perfume. ",5
1841,"This is an underrated fragrance for men. It has elements that remind me of woods, tobacco and spices. It is aromatic and has great projection for several hours. When it finally becomes a skin scent, after over 6 hours, it still smells good up close. Women like this on a man. If they happen to get into your personal space, even after all day...they will ask what you are wearing.",4
1841,"This fragrance isn't bad at all especially for the price. I bought this blind based on reviews I have seen and it was a good buy. I recommend this to everyone who likes a more musky yet sweet smelling fragrance, I have the 1.0 oz right now but I will purchase the full sized bottle when I run out.",4

1844,"This cologne is awesome, for the man with a Attitude of masculine grace. It's great for whatever the occasion may be. Especially for the subtle Woman - it knocks them out with the aroma. It's so cunning, baffling and powerful."" THE BARRON COLOGNE IS THE BOMB """,5

1849,"My favorite summer scent. Big blast of lemon rind in the opening, not too sweet, kind of earthy. Complex. A masterpiece. ",5
1849,Voyage d'Hermes is a crisp citrus scent that wears nicely... The citron definitely softens during the dry down.,4
1849,Absolutely love it! If you like Terre you will like this one! ,5
1849,My french friend came having it and i was amazed. ,5
1850,This is my all time favorite perfume from 1964 and I have exclusively worn it for many years of my life.. BEST PERFUME EVER!!!! So happy you sell it here!!! ,5
1850,I love this scent. It has become so much a part of me. I have worn it since 1970 exclusively and still get compliments. I love the subtleness of the fragrance and the fact that it is not as overpowering as some of the newer fragrances. Please don't stop supplying it!,5

1855,My favorite keep coming back to it just love the citrus smell ,5
1855,"Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Limon Verde...Wow, love this fragrance so much! The minute I sprayed it on, I knew this would forever be a fragrance I would always have in my collection! It's perfect...green, lemony, and subtle yet gets noticed. You won't be disappointed! It's like a summer day sipping lemoncello with a green, grassy note! It's fresh and clean and just amazing!",5
1855,I am in LOVE with this fragrance. I have blindly bought just about every one from this line and this is my favorite by far. It smells exactly as the title reads and the juice appears in the bottle. Green/fresh lemon/lime top notes that stay with you. None of these Guerlains from the Aqua Allegoria line last all day but it is worth carrying it with you to refresh through the day. Totally worth it. Beautiful fresh clean citrus.,5
1856,This is a subtle fragrance. Kinda flowery and spicy scent that lasts for hours. Always get compliments when I wear this.,5
1856,I love Armani Code. It is fresh and clean. I like to layer my perfumes with their corresponding lotions for a long lasting scent. The lotions are also typically very smooth.,5
1856,Armani code for women...love this scent ,5
1856,"I love Armani code. The scent is clean and fresh, very organic. I like layering my perfume with the coordinating lotion for a longer lasting scene. Typically the lotions that are made along with the perfumes are very good lotions.",5
1856,"Armani Code body lotion is great! It smells so good and it last for hours, it's not too strong, it's just right, I would recommend it to anyone.",4
1858,Worst smelling perfume ever. I made a mistake purchasing it..,1
1860,This is my favorite perfume. If you love fresh scents you will love it to.,5
1860,Clean rain is a lovely lite fresh scent. ,5
1860,"Clean Rain is exactly what the name implies. New to this cologne, but I am hooked. Fresh, clean and not flowery. Love, love, love, CLEAN RAIN. Will buy it again. Hope you don’t take it away.",5
1860,"This fragrance is so light, so subtle, so clean, I just lose it. Nothing musky or heavy, or overly floral, it’s a very fresh scent. ",5
1860,I love how the scent starts out but on me once it dries it smells a little rubbery. ,5
1861, This fragrance was as a gift. I can smell the orange scent on it. It’s huge for a big bottle worth every penny. He loved it. ,4
1862,"This is Christian Dior Fahrenheit's fresh brother! Imagine Fahrenheit without the petrol and grease and you have Dunhill Fresh. This is SO long-lasting! It has become one of my all-time favorites. It smells nothing like all the other Dunhill fragrances, but it certainly is on of the best smelling Dunhill fragrances. Once you try it, you'll be hooked! A+",5
1864,Fujiyama is an Excellent fragrance! And for the price... you can’t beat it! Can definitely be considered unisex and mixes well other fragrances both men and women. Smells similar to CK1,5
1864,First time trying. Not as sweet as I thought it would be but still a nice fragrance. ,3
1864,Light and casual. It can be a unisex fragrance. Be generous and spritz it on freely. At that price it is an absolute bargain! FragranceNet makes life fun!,5
1864,I Love Fujiyama been using this perfume for many years now..i love the light fragrance because i dont like strong perfumes..i recommend it to every woman that likes to smell nice..i get stopped in the bus or in the market to be asked that what perfume am i wearing because it smells very nice.,5
1864,"I have been wearing this fragrance for 15 years. I found it on a business trip in Montreal one year. I have more compliments on this scent than any other and practically every time I wear it. Perfect for daytime. Fresh, light, citrusy. I absolutely love it! I order 4 bottles at a time and ensure I am never without.",5
1865,"Homme l'eau boisée by Guerlain is a fascinating scent when first sprayed. Unfortunately no one will notice it after fifteen minutes. (You can always re-apply, I suppose.)",3
1865,"Very nice and woodsy, with a sparkling citrus entry and a pungent Vetiver middle. Good projection and excellent sillage. Great for evening and days off but may be a little loud for the office. ",5
1865,"Update, I remember what else this reminds me of, besides Terre d Hermes, one of Salvatore Ferragamo's scents. Not sure which one but I remember thinking "" hamster cage"" due to cedar note. I had to test again just now and it hit me the same. Let me be clear, I do not like fresh, sporty or aqua scents (or anything else mainstream or mall fragrances). If you do, this may be worth a try.",3
1865,Love this fragrance Guerlain L Eau Boisee perfect for the heat and humidity down here in Miami perfectly blended what a great deal this is such an underrated fragrance should have bought a bigger bottle its was a blind buy pleasantly surprised and impressed,5
1865,"Guerlain Vetiver is my ""signature fragrance"" I also like Imperiale in the summer. My nose recognizes certain Guerlain fragrances: Habit Rouge, Shalimar, Mitsuoko and Jicky. Side note: a perfume shop person once told me that Sean Connery wore Jicky. I was curious about Guerlain Homme L'eau Boisee. I ordered the 'sample' size, despite the fact that the shipping charge was higher than the product price. L'eau Boisee is reminiscent of Halston's 1980's ""Z-14"" - too strong for my taste, but nonetheless it's a ""classic"" scent. ",4
1866,Jessica McClintock Body Lotion is my absolute favorite fragrance. It is light and fresh and I receive compliments on the fragrance frequently. I also use the perfume -- but use the Body Lotion daily.,5
1868,This is one fragrance that the more you smell it the more you fall in love with it it is really potent and a rose bomb that is so good I can’t stop smelling it Eric from you tube said to get your nose on it that it was that good he’s totally right I can’t say enough about this fragrance I’m really glad I pulled the trigger on this one get it you won’t be disappointed and for the guys afraid of this kinda scent your really missing out,5
1869,I ordered the YSL tester and was very pleased with the look as well as the quality of the product. I will definitely be ordering again!!!,5
1869,All I can say Is it is GREAT I am always complimented on how good I smell. What is your fragrance? I am always asked.,5
1869,"I got an Yves St. Laurent variety pack from my Aussie friend who bought it at the Duty Free Shop at the airport, and hands down, Manifesto was my favorite out of all of them. ""Yummy is the word I like to use as it's sexy and sweet without being too heavy or overwhelming. Definitely won't want to ever run out of this addictive scent! ",5
1869,All I can think of to say is: DELICIOUS !!,5
1869,This fragrance is so complex and rich. I love it !! I kept sticking my nose down my blouse all day to smell !!,5
1870,Love it. Smells so wonderful.,4
1871,On time I m impressed ,5
1872, Nautica is simply the very best cologne and aftershave on the market. It's all I have ever used. Love it. ,5
1874,"Poison Girl perfume by Christian Dior-I recommend this perfume,smells like Poison but a light romantic sweet floral version.",5
1874,Dior did not let me down with this one. It's a pretty fregrence and smells nice on me. It's more like a big girly fregrence. Can't wait to wear it more and more.,4
1874,Love Poison Girl-CD. Nice light fragrance. sweet smelling. perfect for everydasy. I want a full size bottle,5
1874,"WoW! A very pleasant surprise. A very refined Vanilla is in the front and center of this softly powerful parfum. Bought it for my daughter, this mature dad is O.K. with the sophisticated lower key sexiness that this scent combines with an all occasion wearability. Don't be put off by the word GIRL in the name, this is a high end scent women of all ages can rock. EXQUISITE, could last longer for my taste, but a decent 5-7 hours of Fabulous awaits you. ",5
1874,Every parfume I want is sold out! Pleeeeese restock soon..,5
1875,This is a wonderful perfume and has great staying power on me..it’s not strong..but strong enough to keep you smelling really great and pretty. I highly recommend this wonderful perfume. My husband doesn’t like many of the perfumes I wear but he likes this one. ,5
1875,"S by shakira is a nice fragrance it is EDT so it does not last long, it is oriental but it doesn’t feel woody it feels more floral, i like to wear sweety fragrances but i feel like this fragrance is a little sweet it makes it very usable for me, you can wear it in the day or night. ",4
1875,Shakira S...I like this perfume a lot. I also love her music too. One or two sprays and I'm good for the day. ,5

1877,Valentina turned out to be one of my favorites. I absolutely love it. ,5
1877,"Valentina by Valentino is a very subtle fragrance. The best thing about this perfume is the bottle, it's really beautiful and delicate. It didn't work for me but it's not bad. Thank Goodness I bought the small bottle.",3
1877,The original one. Perfect ,3
1877,"A soft, elegant yet subtle fragrance. It makes me feel warm, cozy and yes, sexy. I love this fragrance and know that I will be purchasing this again and again!",5
1879,"Vince Camuto Fiore by far my favorite scent. So feminine, sweet-like, but not overpowering. And the body lotion is a must have. With some perfumes, the lotion is not quite the same. Not with this body lotion, such a beautiful fragrance, exactly in line with the perfume. And FragranceNet prices are the best!! ",5
1880,What better way to give special thanks on this Thanksgiving Day than with a bottle of Guerlain Apres L’ondee edt?,5
1880,"Guerlain Après L'ondée is a classic essential for every collection. It's lovely, familiar light floral fragrance is suitable for anyone, any time.",5
1881,Aramis Soap on a Rope is the ultimate manly soap with a distinguished yet sophisticated aroma made to complement it colognes and other items. It is also the perfect travel companion whether on vacation or business travel. ,5

1882,"Beautiful, peppery-rose fragrance. I get compliments every time. I love it. My favorite. ",5
1882,I enjoy using Balenciaga Rosa Botanica for the cooler months. It softens after a while and is sexy and sophisticated without being overwhelming and lasts throughout the day. It should be used 'gently' and do not over apply. I highly recommend it. It's not a stuffy fragrance either. Cannot go wrong with a Balenciaga anything!,5
1882,I have used flora botanical for the pass two-year and the more I use it the more I fall in love with it I get so many comments I think I will make that my next favorite Parfums i am give it to my favorite friends small bottle you know ,5
1882,"Like a lot of fragrances this seems a bit intense but softens. If you like a sexy fragrance, this is it! I don't like putting scents in categories, but this is different and I believe can be worn by anyone at any time. Don't smell much 'rose' in here. Maybe because that's why I love it.",5
1883,Bulgari Rose Goldea absolutely love it. Always getting compliments on it. Great to be able to buy it at such an economical price too Thank you,5
1883,"Bulgaria Goldia Rose, Love It!!!!",5

1887,"Thank you very much , I REALLY ENJOY it IT'S the only thing I use .it SURE was nice to find it at a great price. EDDIE G.. JOHN VARVATOS...",5
1887,I could not wait to get this fragrance and it didn't disappoint. I got this one for me because i absolutely love this scent.,4
1887,Love the sweet smell,5
1887,I TRIED JOHN VARVATOS STAR USA AND WAS VERY SATISFIED . A NICE COLOGNE AT A GREAT PRICE,4
1887,This is pretty good cologne with a light inoffensive scent that you can wear daily (particularly at the office). I have received tons of compliments. ,4
1888,I originally got a free sample of this from a makeup shop and I loved it immediately. It is vanilla and both floral. It’s one of those grown up scents that pack a huge punch and it does hang around all day and continue to develop. For those reasons you only need one spray to last all day so this perfume will last you a long time. Also not a good daily perfume but one to have in your collection but it can become over powering and you’ll be smelling it in bed for days. So it’s up to you if those are pros or cons! ,4
1888,Women are constantly asking “what perfume are you wearing?”. Even 4 year olds are saying “you smell so good”. I love ,5
1888,"I love this one!!!!! My fiancé purchased it for my 48th birthday, and it out shown my outfit when we went on our vacation. The most intriguing aspect is there’s a continuous light scent that remains in your bedding and skin, even after a shower. It seems it continues to blend with your body’s chemistry. I am totally impressed! Juliette Has A Gun Mmmmmm is definitely a keeper!",5
1888,"This scent is delicious! I think it's a heavenly warm and lightly sweet scent, with notes of vanilla and florals. It's vanilla all grown up! I spray it lightly, because you don't need to wear a lot to pick up on the scent. Like other Juliet Has A Gun perfumes, I find this lasts all day on me, and clings lightly to hoodies and jackets for days. I love that.

1912,"Habanita eau de parfum by Molinard Interesting scent. Took me a while to decide if I liked it as it is quite strong initially and definitely not a fresh daytime fragrance, although I have it on at the moment (daytime) and don't dislike it. When I first tried it I thought it was a bit old ladyish, which sounds awful, but in fact it is quite lovely, just old fashioned and sophisticated. It seems to get better as time goes on, softening down to a beautiful subtle scent. Beautiful bottle. My usual scents are Youth Dew, Shalimar and Je Reviens. I also like Jovan Musk for Women for the daytime. I dislike most modern scents as I find them metallic and very overpowering.",5
1912,"Habanita Molinard,Very dark smoky vanilla clouds...so mysterious,yet lovely slightly floral in a faint hint,the smell of makeup powder as a woman at a 1920's party applies her L'orreol powder,men smoking in their suits in the backround,a little bit of everything,yet so romantic&dark yet smooth and breathtaking at the same whiff....I don't know why but there's something comforting about this to me,green stems in a vase of fresh water also I pick up ...and I usually don't like that in a perfume,this would be great for a costume party....but I like to be different,just spray lightly this lasts&is powerful!

1914,Hanae Mori HIM this is one of the best fragrances I've ever encountered/smelled. I first tried the original HM and was blown way by it's sublime and subtle essence. I ordered the HM HIM at the same time but waited a few days to try. Boy oh boy! What a great smell. For those that enjoy Oriental and spice this takes the cake. This deserves five-stars and is totally appropriate for any event. Where it could be an anytime essence I would reserve it for an evening out. Thanks Hanae Mori ,5
1914,"HIM by Hanae Mori is a cologne that is appropriate to be worn on all occations. It doesn't overwhelm you but just enough to make you smell amazing, at work, shopping or walking around the city. I highly recommend this cologne for men above all other colognes. ",5

1917,"Jicky is one of the most exotic and long lasting scents I have ever tried. It has become my new favourite, replacing Chanel Number 5, which was a difficult decision. I like it's initial sharp impact and the lingering delicate floral and smokey sandalwood drift. It's such a delight to wear and I get noticed any time I leave the house. I spray some on each night before i go to sleep and wake up to the delight aroma of Nicky teasing my senses and reminding me it's going to be a great day!",5

1921,"Guerlain L'Instant Pour Homme, is a very nice, fresh, year-round cologne. It's very citrus and upon first application, it has a strong note of lemon. Then it settles very nicely. I can't say that this is a compliment monster, but a few attractive girls have stopped me cold and said,""Excuse me, but what are you wearing?"" I mean there are a million fragrances out there, but guys give this one a try. I wish the EDP version was available here, but it's sold out.",4

But, after a couple of minutes after the perfume dissolved into my skin it was just a magnificent smell of powder and a vanilla like sugary scent which I love. I would recommend this perfume to anyone who loves those perfumes that dry down to like a fresh, powdery, sugar like smell.",5

I really like this scent as it is a nice blend between peppery and fruit. I hate peppery smells...even on a man...so this is definitely a great purchase!

1940,"Gorgeous ample bottle, a deep dark scent that is very different than others around. Intense and a little acidic so a little goes a long way. Spicy, woody, rose-floral with a strange twist of hellebore which is a little rose-mossy but not patchouli-like. Hellebore is known to have a hallucinogenic scent so be prepared. I mist it over my hair and people will bury their faces in it when I wear it. Excellent gothy choice. A bit too heavy for day wear though.",5

1943,"Nice fragrance...It seems though not as long lasting as it once was years ago. Back in Paris in 1984 I discovered Cacharel, It seemed a lot more intriguing. May be a cheaper blend these days, or maybe my senses aren’t what they use to be?",4

I had to stop what I was doing to rush back in the store to purchase this product, which says a lot as I have been wearing the same scent now for ten years and have never found just what I wanted enough to change.

1959,"One Man Show Gold Edition is a very powerful scent. It's not for everyone, but there is a lot to love about it. The overall impression I get from it is sweet pipe tobacco and leather; an oversimplification, but good enough to give you an idea. The line of One Man Show takes bold chances. So if you're the kind of man that is confident in your masculinity and style, this one is for you. It's designed to stand out rather than blend in. ",5

However, men are crazy about it, and I am asked what I am wearing by strangers all the time! My doctor even asked and said he wanted to buy some for his wife. Since my doctor is much younger than I, this was a real compliment for Oscar! It isn’t overbearing, but it does throw well. The cream is nice, as is the lotion and powder. The bubble bath was sensational. ",5

Thought I was ordering La Nuit De L'Homme Intense (not this, La Parfum - Note: Intense is a Parfum too, just nicer and more masculine). Big mistake.

1999,"I love all Angel fragrances, but this one is my signature scent. Its unique but classy, with a hint of masculine notes. Perfect to wear at anytime or season, the fragrance is devine and lasts so very well, maintaining the rich aroma. Angel Comet is the hero of my large collection of Angel scents. Everywhere I go I leave the lasting hint of it that always has everyone commenting on what am I wearing. Love love love this.",5
1999,"ANGEL COMET I HAVE BEEN WEARING THIS SCENT FOR 5 YEARS AND ANGEL, BUT ANGEL COMET IS MY FAVORITE, IT IS A SEXY SCENT THAT LAST ALL DAY WITH A NICE AROMA.

2001,I love this perfume I’ve been using Betsey Johnson for years . I always get Complements for its soft & light hint of musk . ,5
2001,"Betsey Johnson perfume is amazing! I love all of her products, but this perfume takes the cake. It has a very sultry, yet feminine smell, and lasts all day. I got alot of compliments on the fragrance when I wore it. The bottle is very pretty and looks well on my vanity. Won't be disappointed for sure!",5
2001,Love the smell my mom told me about it and I just had to get me some. This Betsey Johnson perfume is the great.,5
2001,Nice fragrance. My husband loves it on me.,5
2001,"I love this perfume, I only wear it occasionally now. But I just purchased it for my daughter who loves it as well. Betsey Johnson is a nice Casual scent that I would recommend for a young woman maybe 18-24 years old. ",4
2005,"I haven't purchased the Cabotine shower gel before but how could I possibly go wrong. Having previously bought the Cabotine eau de parfum I knew what I would be in for. ... a lovely fresh scent to the skin. Please keep producing this item. My other all time favourites are Blonde by Versace but needless to say I can't find that anywhere, Shalimar and Samsara- Guerlain.",4
2005,Cabotine shower gel makes your skin smell incredible. I have used this fragrance for many many years and always get compliments. It smells so light and clean. I hope they never quit making this product. ,5

2008,I purchased CK One Platinum Edition for my husband for Christmas and all I can say is it’s “hot man in a bottle”! For reference I adore Aqua Di Gio for men so it’s in that fragrance family. Awesome deal for the amount you get!!! 6 oz is HUGE!,5
2010,The rose cool water for women is a particularly nice light scent. Great for going to the beach or the very least to make you feel like you're there . I definitely recommend this perfume.,5
2011,I like the Christiano Ronado Cr7. I get a lot of compliments on how good it smells. ,5
2012,"I bought this to give it a try and am not overly impressed. The price was great, so I figured ""what the heck"". Nothing spectacular. It is very fruity, like orange juice in the morning/wake up fruity. It seems to be a more childish scent, good for a teenager. It is actually pretty gender neutral, perhaps because of the sandalwood. Meh, not wowed. Probably won't wear it. Not sure I like the scent enough to gift it either.",2
2012,I tried this scent several years ago and like it says Kicks...I do love it and very soft not strong like some perfumes which are overpowering. This is light and beautiful. Love it! ,5
2012,"Surprisingly, Kicks is an elegant and beautiful fragrance. It gets better as the day wears on. Excellent value for the price. You won't be disappointed. ",5
2014,"A much smoother and versatile version of Dior Homme, Dior Homme Eau is slightly fresher whilst maintaining the signature iris of the DH line. Unlike DH, DHE is more suited for the day, as well as warmer temperatures. Lasts several hours on my skin and the dry down is just amazing. A safe fragrance to blindbuy",5
2014,"Dior homme eau. Great smell. Doesn't smell like an orange at all! Need to get your nose checked! Nice clean, fresh scent! Smells close to the same as Dior homme. Just a little different. Recommended! Many compliments! One of my favorites. ",5

2014,I have bought this twice lasts long and smells great!! I don't get the orange comment at all,5
2014,"DIOR HOMME EAU by Christian Dior is a masculine scent with woody, musky and oriental notes. The scent last a very long time but is not overpowering or offensive. Both my son (24yrs) and long-term partner (55yrs) enjoy this scent and get numerous compliments when wearing it. It is definately one that will remain in our household as the go-to Fragrance for my guys!",5
2016,"This is basically a clone of Carolina Herrera 212 VIP. I got this simply because I wanted Trump's fragrances in my collection. I'm not actually crazy about this scent, but it isn't bad. It's just not one of my favorites. I wear it from time to time. The price is obviously right so there is nothing to complain about.",4
2016,This is amazing scent that all the women love it when i go out Then i mention Trump and they are shocked as I was!,5
2016,I bought my husband the Trump Empire gift set. I love it. Smells wonderful!!,5

2018,Fendi Fan di Fendi Aqua super sexy..sexy..masculine and unforgettable..this is the one...,5
2019,Fifth Avenue After Five is a sweet but soft scent that smells wonderful on and others smell it when you cant. It is a soft beautiful scent that brings out the inner beauty. I've been wearing it for 5 years now and it has become one of my favorites.,5
2019,I love this soft feminine scent; it is not overwhelming to give me a headache or aggravates my bronchitis.,5
2019,"I like it very much. It's a very interesting yet beautiful scent. It's sweet, it smells like honey and flowers to me. Like nothing I've ever worn before. The price and the the amount was great so I took a chance. I'm glad I did. Elizabeth Arden is a fragrance genius. ",5
2019,Sweet scent...can't get enough of it...my daughter loves it,5
2020,"Jaguar Pace is a true gem!!. Is clean, fresh, and enticing! To me it reminds me of CK Eternity Aqua, but smoother, richer, and warmer. Projection is just ok, but if you are hugging and cuddling with your girl, then she'll love it!!",5
2020,Better than most high end fragrances!,5
2020,Best smelling stuff out there!,5
2020,"This is some good smelling stuff! I was taken back, because of the cost. I love fragrances and have a nice collection. Sometimes you don't have to break the bank to smell fine. If I was to compare this, I would have to say it has a Gucci Guilty black smell. Only much better! ",5
2022,"Jovan Sex Appeal after shave, my husband has used this product for over 40 years. I was crushed when they quit selling it in the stores. I bought the spray but it doesn't have very much of a fragrance. I'm so glad I have found it again. I have ordered 3 bottles and probably will order more so I can have a good supply on hand. Please don't quit selling it. I want to smell that sexy fragrance for years to come. ",5

I absolutely love the fresh smell, the only thing is... it doesn't last that long and it's not that strong... so next time I'm going to buy the Liz Sport Perfume, I had gotten it before and loved it!!! The body spray is good for getting out of the shower and spraying something fresh on before bed time.",3

2028,"I have been using OPEN EDT (for men) by Roger & Gallet for years, since a French Pharmacist recommended it. It was her favourite EDT for her friends. It is certainly a refreshing and distinctive cologne suitable for all day and evenings. I am often asked what is the name of the cologne. ",5
2028,"I buy Open for my husband, it's his favorite.",5
2029,"This fragrance is just amazing. It lasts a long time, and it smells beautiful. I have received many compliments over the years about how I smell nice, and it's all thanks to this wonderful perfume. I highly recommend it!!",5

2031,"I ordered the lovely, Shalimar Souffle De Parfum, a scent of a thousand nights, with the beautiful peacock on the bottle. It is a veritable feast for eyes, nose and skin. I luxuriate in it when I wear it. It was divinely inspired, by a great scent maker, it is heavenly.",5
2031," I bought Shalimar Souffle edp as a blind buy. No regrets at all-I love it! I ordered another bottle soon after receiving this one. The Shalimar bath powder blends nicely with it-picks up the citrus note. Will be nice for the warmer months, especially. Stunning bottle, also!",5
2031, Shalimar is my absolute favorite perfume. It isn't too sweet and overpowering but leaves a lasting impression. ,5
2031,"I have always been a Guerlain fan, but this particular Shalimar is what every woman wants & needs to express their inner self outwardly. Shalimar Souffle De Parfum is the answer",5
2031,"I was something different than a traditional Shalimar, and this modern interpretation is just lovely ",5
2032,"So Oscar De La Renta body mist is nice and lite, mixed with the lotion and spray toilette that I recently ordered is a good springtime addition. ",4
2033,There are not enough words to describe how great Valentino Valentina Pink is. The scent of this perfume is great. My spirit is lifted everytime I smell the intoxicating aroma. If you have not yet experienced this scent please go out and get if you are an avid perfume collector! ,5
2035,"I've been wearing A Scent by Issey Miyake since it first came on the market and I was so disappointed when it was no longer available in the UK. My only ways of getting it now are buying it via FragranceNet or when I visit family in Canada so when I get the opportunity I stock up. Even 10 years on I still love this fragrance. It's robust enough that you can spray it on in the morning and it still gets commented on in the late afternoon (which is saying something since I've sprayed it on at 5.30am). It has a light, fresh scent that settles down into something I would personally equate to my second favourite scent of freshly laundered cotton that's been drying outside in the sunshine. To me it's got everything I want in a fragrance, it's light, fresh and smells a bit like the outdoors. Still love it and always will love it. ",5
2035,A Scent by I'd Issey Miyake smells heavenly! ,5
2035,"still unsure about this one...seems like Calyx at first--which I love--but then gets this intense, pungent lily of the valley note that sort of nauseates me",3
2035,"A scent by Issey miyake is subtle, smells fresh",4
2035,"This scent happens to be one of Issey Miyake's better ones. You put it on in the morning & you still get compliments in the late afternoon. I've reccomended this scent to several people since I've been wearing it. Everywhere I go someone always asks me what perfume I'm wearing. What a compliment for Issey Miyake. Thanks Issey Miyake, this is a wonderful scent & I must I do love the compliments I get when wearing it.",5
2036,"So happy with all 3 of my purchases. Hypnotic Poison, Theirry Muglar Floria and and Dylan Blue by Paca Rabanne. FRAGRANCENET IS AWESOME AND HAS AWESOME PRICES. THANKS FOR THE DISCOUNTS!!!",5
2036,"FLORA FUTURA. What a magnificent fragrance. My new favorite. Based upon the heady and exotic Night Blooming Cereus, a cactus flower that blooms only one night out of the entire year! This scent is Not ""gormand"" like other Thierry Mugler scents, which I dislike. Even though this is a toilette and not available as a parfum, it has staying power, much more than Narcisco Rodriquez for Her, which I love but does not last. I wear a number of scents such as Joy by Jean Patou, Chanel's Allure Sensuelle and Coco Madamoiselle, all of which are strong feminine scents that leave a lasting impression like this one.",5
2038,"She is happy, I am happy Christina Aguilera",5
2038,Christina Aguilera- it’s a little musky. Smells good but not great. Wish I would have gotten the vial in this and the bigger bottle is her pure seduction scent! ,2
2038,"I Love this Christina Perfume,my friends always compliment me when I’m wearing it",5
2038,"I Love this Christina Perfume,my friends always compliment me when I’m wearing it",5
2038,awesome perfume so pleasant not enough words to express what a wonderful perfect mix and it is no wonder it won so many awards!! ,5
2039,"I have purchased several of the Clean line scents. While shopping on Fragrance Net a few months ago, I noticed that there were some new scents that I've never seen before so decided to buy Clean Lovegrass and I'm so glad I did! It smells so fresh and reminds me of a Spring morning. I'm around several people on a daily basis that are allergic or sensitive to most perfumes and they love this fragrance and it doesn't bother them. Will be buying again soon!",5
2041,This is nice !,3
2041,"This has nothing to do with desire red; this is a ""leather"" fragrance, rich, matura, elegant; i don´t have comparisson; is a litlle dark, and is no sweet (as modern scents). performance is ok, good sillage, and 5 hours of longevity. the drydown has a hint of the leather on Van cleef & arpels homme.",4
2042,fifth avenue nights very nice,5
2042,"This is not a flowery perfume and it is not a outdoorsy woodsy fragrant. I like the crisp like-outdoor smell of air after a good rain. it can be worn by anyone, teen, middle age. I have gotten many compliments at the office by men and women (who were opium and the like) and after 5pm I can still smell it. It's just a light type of smell and now is my signature perfume. Smells expensive but the price is great! ",5
2043,"Gucci Bamboo is the perfect scent for summer! I waited to buy it because I thought it might be too strong or flowery. It leaves a light scent, not overpowering. I wish I had bought it sooner!",5
2043,I love this fragrance. I wear it with confidence. It’s soft elegant and long lasting. I get so many compliments when wearing this scent! Gucci Bamboo is my signature scent! ,5
2043,"My girlfriend mentioned she had tried Bamboo at a counter and enjoyed it. I placed an order with gift wrapping and shipped directly to her apartment. She could not thank me enough. She wants to wear it on our next date night at the ballet. I like a small amount on my handkerchief, to remind me of her when we're apart. I appreciate the excellent service.",5
2043,"Got this at a great price! It smells awesome! I was looking for something more woodsy than fruity/floral like i usually get. This is perfect - its warm and soft and versatile for any season. It just arrived in the mail yesterday and ive become obsessed with smelling myself. Only issue I have is I cannot tell how long it lasts, so the lotion helps a lot. ",4
2045,I'm on this fence with L'Eau d'Issey Absolue. This reminds me very much of a lighter version of Elizabeth Arden's Sunflowers. I think it will be nice in very hot weather. It is too sheer and light to use in the cooler months. Summer heat might make it project and be more than just the skin scent it is now as silage is practically non-existent. Longevity isn't the greatest either. From what I can smell it seems like it is good quality though. Issey's scents are known for being sheer and light so unless you know that upfront you won't be disappointed. ,3
2045,L'Eau D' Issey Absolue. I absolutely love this fragrance. It's a very good smell. I will be purchasing a bigger bottle in the near future! ,5
2045,"Love Issey Miyake's fragrance Absolue. I have the eau de cologne too and wanted a bit more lasting effect. The perfume is heavier and more lasting but not as strong as I anticipated. Another reviewer said it also wasn't long lasting on her so maybe it is my chemistry also. It is absolutely lovely, though, and I'm very happy with my purchase. I will have to spray more on my clothes!",5
2045,"L'eau D'Issey Absolue is incredible, even just by sniffing the bottle. It's tuberose with the right amount of sweetness from honey and vanilla. Perfect for spring and summer. It only lasts on my skin for about 3-4 hours, but that is normal for Issey's fragrances and my chemistry. Layering or spraying directly on clothes definitely helps.",4
2046,This smells like Stella Rose Absolute Intense! I LOVE this!,5
2046,L’Extase Nina Ricci is so nice. I smelled so many at the airport then couldn’t get it out of my mind. It came in a box and lots of extra & a sample for travel. Thanks ,5
2046,L´Extase Nina Ricci have a nice aroma. Especial for any occasion. That is the second time I buy this parfum. I love it.,5
2047,L'Homme Sport Yves Saint Laurent its good and sexy i bought it a month ago but it smells like L'Homme Yves Saint Laurent that i have tried before i get no comments from any one wearing L'Homme Sport Yves Saint Laurent. it also smells masculine when i put it on.,5
2047,Bought this for my husband for Christmas. YSL Sport. I really love the YSL fragrances! ,5
2048,"Definitely a delicious scent , I love it!!",5
2048,This perfume is divine! With a powdery clean scent that lasts all day. Men or women will Ask what your wearing . Perfect for any occasion this perfume is different then any other scent on the market . ,5
2048,"L'Instant Magic - This scent is light yet lasting...vanilla comes thru but not cloyingly sweet. A perfect choice for day to night. The kind of scent a woman will ask ""what are you wearing"" and a man will just tell you, you smell great. Guerlain has been a great house for a long time for good reason! other favorites: Jardin des Bagatelle, Mitsouko...now L'Instant Magic",5
2048,the best perfume in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
2049,Live Irresistible Blossom Crush is fabulous. I love the scent of sweet and bitter together. It gives you a happy smell. Love it JG,5

2049,"Beautiful, soft, lasting... I really like this scent ",5
2049,"Live irresistible blossom by Givenchy is everything I excepted it to be and more. I just can't get over the smell. Love the smell so much, so sweet and fit my personality perfectly well. ",5
2051,"I really like Nautica Blue.. it has a light, clean smell. It is my ""anytime"" sent. ",5
2052,"I owned many Parfums de Marley such Layton,Ojan, Galloway, and I smells others at Depatment stores. Perceival is the best for me, It smells very fresh, clean and make you feel elegant and confident. People will ask about it as it smells so good.",5
2053,"This is THE fragrance. I have yet to find a lady who CAN'T ""keep her hands off of me"" when I'm wearing it. If you're being ""friend zoned""...BUY THIS!! I was almost in tears when my nephew chose this fragrance to wear on his ""first date"". A ""MUST"" for your fragrance ""arsenal"". Even If you DON'T own the car...Porsche The Essence by Porsche Design will make her want you to ""hug her curves"" as If you did.",5
2054,"I had written a review once already and don’t know what happened so I’m gonna write another one, so whether u are a Rihanna fan or not this fragrance of hers called Reb’ L Fleur Love Always is great and smells sooooo good. I truly love all of Rihanna’s fragrances and I have all of her fragrances but one and I’m about to order the one that I don’t have. I don’t know whether you ladies are sleep on this fragrance or what but I had never smelled this fragrance of Rihanna’s before and it was a blind buy on my part but one day I was just browsing and had went back to order the one fragrance of Rihanna’s that I didn’t have and noticed that she had a new fragrance which was called Reb’L Fleur Love Always and decided to order this one first but it was sold out when I tried to buy it and it was sold out on other fragrance lines as well so I ended up back on fragrancenet and it was sold out again and finally it was back in stock and believe it or not they said it was sold out again, I was very disappointed so I called them to ask when we’re they gonna get the fragrance back in because for some reason I keep missing it and they told me that they were gonna be able to fill my order because I had just got the last bottle, I was hoping that all that I had went thru to get this fragrance that I hope it was worth it and it really really really was worth it so all of you Rihanna’s fragrance fans or not you will definitely love this fragrance and just in case if you go to FragranceNet and they are sold out don’t get discouraged just keep checking back I’m sure they will have it in, and most of all not only does it smell good it’s long lasting, Thanks FragranceNet you hit another home run with this fragrance!!!!!",5
2055,"For my son , personally I think is great for a kid especially with the logo.",4
2056,I am 49 and ordered Baby Tous for myself. I get a lot of migraines and cant wear strong perfume. This fragrance is crisp and fresh. It smells so wonderful. A lot stronger scent than I was expecting but I love it!,5
2056,I loved for my boy .,5
2056,My grandson loves it,4
2056,You can use it or let your BABY use it and Will feel fresh and clean,5

2058,"Lyric Man is a lovely soapy rose that brings me so much joy. It is a super unique fragrance that is not like anything you smell too often. After going through an entire decant, I had to come through and cop myself a full bottle. It is my personal favorite from the house. ",5
2058,Lovely. Will try a different fragrance next time. ,5
2058,"Amouage lyric is not what I expected, although it has a nice smelling fragrance, I believe in my preference the rose type smell would be more suitable for a lady! I wil try a different fragrance from Amouage lyric in the future.",4
2058,It is an awesome perfume. Perfect for any occasion. It is my best purchase so far that I have made.,5
2058,Wife really loves this fragrance on me ,4
2059,Apple Bottoms eau de parfum by Nelly I-think-that-this-scent-should-have-been-more-potent. No-one-new-I-was-wearing-it.,1
2059,Apple Bottoms - I like the scent just wish it came in an big size.,4
2059,I really liked this fragrance. It has a blend of bottom notes woods with a top note of sweetness. I would order again if it came in a larger size. ,3
2059,I personally don't care for this scent. We got a mini size to try it out. My daughter likes it and wears it but it's a common scent that I find in most perfumes that are new and I just don't do the common thing. My daughter says it's ok but once it's gone she will not be wearing it again. Thanks for the opportunity to smell it before committing to a big bottle. ,2
2059,"It smells really good in the bottle, I have not had the chance to wear Apple Bottoms yet. I plan on wearing it soon, it smells like one of those perfumes that will get you a lot of attention.",5
2060,Bottega Veneta is the most alluring perfume I have encountered. It does not arrive before you enter the room but as people walk near you they can't help commenting on the wonderful scent. I am forever grateful to my friend Linda who suggested it to me. I really love it. If you want to make a lasting impression on anyone do it with this perfume-once encountered it's unforgetable.,5
2060,"Bottega Veneta took all time favorite fragrance with me at a recent reunion. Once my friend, who is a perfume junkie, told me the name I couldn't wait to order it. I love, love love it! So does everyone I'm with. The discount here is great. ",5
2060,"Bottega Veneta - subtle, sensual scent! ",5
2060,I so wish it came in a roller ball!,5
2060,"Bottega Veneta has captured my heart and soul. My girlfriend of many years shared with me her love of real perfume and this has made such a difference in my whole life. When I spritz just a small amount on my pulse points and go about my day , I have grown used to random people (women and men)asking me, “Excuse me I’m curious to know what scent you are wearing? I hate perfume but I can’t stop following you, I love that smell!” Until I found Bottega Veneta, I only used essential oils; Primarily Frankincense and myrrth. I too, was a purist and didn’t like women or men who entered a room, smelling like a bottle of something man made. Imagine my surprise when I sampled wearing Bottega Veneta, and consistently got such a positive feedback. I have educated myself about the art of making perfume and why it is so expensive. Then to be able to buy it here at such a discoun, Well I’m going to say if you have never thought there was a difference in parfumes, please please please try this one! You will not regret it. ",5
2062,This was a basically the summer edition of light blue and as always D&G didn't disappoint. It's a very elegant scent that can be worn anytime and last all day. It's clean and crisp and drys nice on the skin. If you like light blue you will like this one to I promise ,5
2063,Davidoff Champion - I simple just love smelling this sexy scent on my husband. ,5
2063,The scent is pretty good. It doesn't last very long ( so u can spray a bit extra) wthout it being over bearing. I received tons of compliments and it is a good office scent. ,4

I thought it might be like other fragrance lotions....smells nice, but usually doesn't actually help dry skin. MAJOR SURPRISE.... Fancy body lotion works great...smells as wonderful as the parfum, AND really does help dry hands and the rest of your body feel hydrated!

2080,"Maja body lotion by Myrugia...Translation of Maja means ""elegant lady."" Truly, when you apply this body lotion, that is how you feel...If you want to enter a room and not smell like everyone else in the floral fantasm, but instead enter a room with an exotic, elusive, provocative, mysterious scent, then Maja lotion and perfume is for you...Think flamenco guitars, passion, the signature scent that we all search for..Earthy, spicy, enticing, unforgettable, unique...That is Maja body lotion...I also wear the Maja cologne. I will also add this scent is very comforting, yet vibrant and subtle at the same time...What I really love is that I don't smell like everyone and anyone else, unless of course they have discovered this scent too !",5

When I got to this one, it’s like nothing I’ve ever smelled before. Pure quality. It’s different and just very clean. I’m not quite sure if it’s a spring or summer type fragrance but I’m wearing it now... I have not come across anyone who has names this in their top five, but it’s now in mine.. Check this out",5

2085,"Beautiful soft rose, does not last long on me but is a lovely fresh scent for summer and warm weather. ",5
2085,"Paul Smith Rose is a fresh rose with light green under tones. True rose, as if standing near a pink rose bush. No musky, powdery or dark additives. I wish it lasted a little longer, but you can only smell it on yourself for so long anyway.",4

2087,I bought this fragnance without even try. and its awesome.. ,5
2087,Prada intense was a blind buy for me but am not disappointed. I spray it on in the morning before work and can still smell it at night before bed. Longevity is great...projection I'd say is moderate.,5
2087,"I brought a Prada Intense gift set for my boss a couple of years ago, and fell in love with it. I have worn it every since, and I am a woman!",5
2087,"Nice scent, but short lived, the original last longer.",4
2090,I have been wearing Shalimar since my husband (then boyfriend) bought me some as a Christmas gift in 1968. It is the only scent I like. I am only able to purchase in one store and it is very expensive. Every time I go out someone comments on the heavenly scent. Apparently it stands the test of time. I was lucky enough to see the flagship store in Paris on I believe the Champs Élysées. The body lotion I wear in the daytime as a hint of the glamour to come.,5
2090,I use Shalimar body lotion every day. and the fragrance lasts all day.,5
2090,Shalimar Body Lotion is a great moisturizer and the fragrance lasts all day long. its that fresh out of the shower feeling.,5
2090," I use Shalimar body lotion for after shower and off to work, or a luncheon. The fragrance is not overpowering rather a soft gentle scent. I enjoy that people do not start to exhibit signs of an allergy around me. That is important to me. ",5
2090,Absolutely love it fast shipping will be ordering again from Fragrance Net. Thanks again,5
2091,Sólo by Loewe Amazing fragrance ! The best !,5
2091,"Not a bad scent, just does not last long on my skin. Good out and about fragrance.",5
2093,Symetrie Harmony is the second fragrance that I have tried. Had Symetrie Balance before. They are both delightful. The smell of both is great and i would buy them again. The size is a wonderful value for the money. Give them a try and see for yourself.,5
2093,"I love love love my Symètrie Harmony Perfume! It smells exactly as it did in the sample I received. It's so light, cozy, clean and refreshing at the same time. I wish I could soak myself in this scent.",5
2093,I bought the Symetrie Harmony and I love it so much I bought the love scent and can't wait to get it I am also ordering another one just haven't decided and the bottles are big which makes it even better if you can't decide on a new perfume give one of those a try you won't be disappointed❤❤,5
2093,"I received a card with the samples of the Symetire colognes. I really liked the Symetrie Harmony fragrance and ordered it. he smell is heavenly, but does not last long. it is light and can wear day or night. Also, a good fragrance around patients in a hospital, is not a loud smelling cologne at all.",5
2093,"Harmony is so complex yet so wearable. I'll do my best to describe the scent. Green like forest moss, faint burnt wood, ocean sand, fresh, green tomato. Every note softer and quieter than the next. It warms very quickly and smells like you've been playing outside all day.",5
2094,Its a mild perfume that lingers for a few hours if you dont like a perfume overpowering and strong the symetrie perfumes are good for that reason. I have vision and quest both very mild and acomplimentary scent for men AND women.,3
2094,"I like it not to strong, can't keep my younger brother away from it he says his lady loves the sent ",5
2094,I love this colgne because its not too strong. Smells pleasing to the nose and it kind of reminds me of cool water. But i like this better. I get compliments at least once or more times a day when i wear this cologne. So dont hesitate to buy it. It last about 7 hours on my skin which is good for me then i re-apply if needed. ,5
2094,"While looking for a new cologne recently, I stumbled onto the Symetrie quiz here, and was suggested Vision. I read the description and decided to try it. It's not a bad scent, but it isn't for me. Maybe me about 20 years or so ago when everyone around me thought Cool Water was the best, but not today. It's fresh, crisp, has a clean feel to it, and really is a decent cologne; for those who are into the ""water"" types. My 14 yr old son really likes it, so it wasn't a wasted purchase. ",3
2094,I REALLY LIKE THE COLOGNE!!! IT STAYS THE WHOLE DAY!! I EVEN SPRAY SOME ON MY BED BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP. I RECOMMEND IT.,4
2096,"I received this as a gift and I highly recommended it for women of all ages. Tommy Girl Tropics is a beautiful, all day lasting scent. It is a great everyday to the office or school scent. The musk, grapefruit and orange blossom dry to a soft powdery scent that lingers and rises with body heat. I just love it!!",5
2096,I received my order today and I love it. I’ve been looking for this perfume for 2 years TOMMY GIRL TROPICS smells so good. ,5
2096,I've been wearing this perfume since I got it in the mail and it's amazing!!!,5
2097,smell good. good product,5
2097,Unforgivable body mist is perfect for summer time. ,5
2100,"This scent is very reminiscent of Mugler's Angel, but less in your face. It has OK lasting power (great for the price, about 4-6 hours). I pretty warm, sweet scent.",4
2101,"Wait for the dry down until the vanilla kicks in, then slowly the tonka beans comes in ... maintaining that soft and classy blend of other notes. The ambergris here maintains the balance of all notes like a crescendo of olfactory experience. One of the best Ambre composition out there. LOVE THIS MUCH! and thanks FragranceNet for speed delivery. ",5
2101,"Ambre Imperial Van Cleef & Arpels - Its very captivating scent. Its starts off very sparkling, fresh a little fruity, with hint of spicy. After about 10 minutes mixture with your body chemistry and the weather, it becomes softer and the Vanilla softening up, comforting the woodsy tonka beans... and it stays like that for hours and hours even lingering very smooth and soft gourmandy scent. Bottle is classy represent VC&A sophisticated style. Sillage is strong for couple hours and close to skin for 10-12 hours. Highly recommend ",5
2102,Jubilation 25 is my favorite from the house of Amouage. I love the riches and complexity of the scent. Another thing I love most is the surprises it brings while each note opens layer by layer. This fragrance is a class of its own. Another master piece from Amouage. Love it. ,5
2102,Amouage Jubilation XXV I absolutely love this cologne. I only use half a squirt because it's so strong. I get complements all the time and the range of its projection is at least 10 feet. It's a fall and winter scent so a full bottle will last you at least 2 to 3 years. There isn't a knock off or clone of this and I've searched everywhere. This is by far the most unique and intoxicating cologne I have ever encountered. You must have this in your collection.......PERIOD!,5
2102,Absolutely 100% perfect fragrance,5
2102,"I absolutely admire this fragrance . i purchased this locally for a whopping price and loved this fragrance so much i came here and purchased another one of these for a great price . I love the sweet smoky incense with deep mysterious resinous fruits , simply a mystifying and exotic rich sexual fragrance . 11/10 ",5
2102,"Amouage, Jubilation XXV, is a spicy, berry, adult cocktail, that spills from the bottle with gusto. Good for evening wear and special occasions, or during the day using a lighter application.",5
2103,"I almost missed this fragrance of Queen B call Rise and it smell great I have a lot of her fragrances I think I might have them all by now but I have to check, this is a great for all who like Queen B fragrances and this too was a blind buy!",5
2103,Beyonce Rise is my favorite one out of all the Beyonce collections. This one is great for day or evening wear.,5
2103,I purchase Beyonce Rise love the way it smell .Rise by Beyonce,5
2103,I bought Rise by Beyonce needing a scent and wanting to try; it is cool. Save to wear for people who like to smell you but don't like to be overwhelmed.,3
2104,Very impressed - very classy a gentlemans fragrance - for the price this is surely a great buy It is soft and the dry down is one for all occasions and the business setting ,5
2104,outstanding you must get this one,5
2104,"At this price Bogart Pour Homme is a no brainer. This was a blind buy and a very safe one. Classy, elegant pipe tobacco vibe that makes this scent cozy. This is like a better blended, high class Versace Dreamer.",5
2105,Bois Dore Van Cleef & Arpels is amazing and smells incredible. I love how the scent stays on your all day. Very clean scent.,5
2109,"I collect Designer Colognes. This one I bought blind, honestly because the bottle looked cool and it had some good reviews. It smells like straight cedar wood. Not sure how it might change as it settles because I can't get past the pungent cedar smell. Bottle looks good in the display case though. Lol",3
2109,I love this scent! If I Don’t wear it every day I get in trouble with my coworkers,5
2109,I receive more compliments when I use Duc De Vervins than any other cologne I use. It's the one cologne I go to when going out somewhere special. ,5
2109,"Duc De Vervins is a fresh, sporty scent which will elicit many compliments. I think it is perfect for an office settng or even for those romantic occasions. It draws many comparisons to Drakkar a powerful compliment getter from the 80s', but Duc De Vervins is much smoother and refined...just an incredible scent. ",5
2109,My husband only wears DV or DV extreme. It makes me fall in love with him all over again. Can't miss with this fragrance,5
2110,I remember it from over 40 years ago and I used to wear it then. But this one does not remind me of the fragrance I used to know at all. The alcohol odor comes through very much and it reminds me more of an old bottle of 4711. ,1
2110,"I have been wearing Eau de Rochas forever and finally found out that I actually began to wear it right after it was originally introduced. It is a light, timeless fragrance that even passes the nose test to my ""allergic to perfumes"" friends! I wear it everywhere and whenever and I don't wear any other fragrance for ""those special occasions"" -- Eau de Rochas covers all the bases! ",1
2110,"Eau De Rochas has a fresh, pleasant scent that does not seem to be overwhelming. I have been a fan of Madame Rochas Parfum for many years ... thought that I should try something new. I wish that the bottle had a spray pump ... the rather large bottle is a bit awkward to dab out just the right amount. ",4
2110,"Eau de Rochas is perfect, fresh and suitable for any occasion.",5
2110,Eau de Rochas for Women. A Classic pleasant fragrance for everybody of all ages. You never get tired of it and people around you like it too.,5
2112,"I picked out Eternity Summer for a friend, a very subtle fragrance long lasting if you have the body chemistry for it you will turn heads daily",5
2112,I love this so much I bought another for my best friends birthday.,5
2112,"Been using Eternity for many years, classy perfume , for any age it's still smells just as nice at the end the day ...ordering Eternity Summer ..am sure I will be pleased and satisfied with wearing it too. ",5
2112,It's a bit too flowery for me. I prefer the original Eternity to ths scent.,3
2112,"i love this perfume ,",4
2113,"Fantasy body mist ❤️ It’s great, just enough but not overpowering. ",5
2115,"Great Scent! Masculine, Fresh, Modern, without spice! Translates to Woody, Citrus - The only problem: DOES NOT LAST LONG! I wish there was a parfum. 4 out of 5",4
2115,"Used to have this fragrance long time ago and cherished every drop until it finished, I give Higher Dior a ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐rating beautiful scent.",4
2115,"Worn cologne since high school and don't plan on changing...I label it a ""masculine, sexy and professional scent.""",5
2116,WAS SUPRISED TO FIND ANOTHER REALLY GREAT SCENT ,5
2116,"kanon-norwegian-wood Love the woody smell of this fragrance, however it doesn't seem to last long. I have to spray it on every few hours. ",3
2116,"Its worth the wait. You should give it a chance because it is different and worth the price. The fragrance is unique and it is woody, no complaint here. Try it!",3
2117,"I have worn Kelly for a year, I am always complemented when least expecting. ",5
2117,Kelley Caleche has been a favorite of mine for 11 years - I switch off between this and Iris Poudre by Malle. Of course Malle is too expensive to wear liberally daily that is where Caleche comes in. The scent is strong but not overpowering - it is has a very pleasant mix of its tones - not florally. I feel comfortable wearing a business suit or a dinner dress with this fragrance. It lasts all day and is a PERFECT CHOICE,5
2117,I bought this Kelly Caleche for my wife thinking of leathery and floral smell but for my taste the leather smell is too strong you smell like leather all day. Maybe the toilette version is better...,3
2118,I recently purchased Kenneth Cole Black spray. I love it! It has a.mild but floral scent that stays with me all day. I've had numerous compliments on the scent. I would recommend this scent and product ,5
2118,Love it - Kenneth Cole ,5
2118,Love it- Kenneth Cole,5
2120,Mankind is one of my favorite colognes and when I ran out I searched for it on the Web. I was delighted to find it at about a third of the price I had paid before. ,5
2120,"Kenneth Cole Mankind Ultimate is a great fragrance. Wood, Citrus & Cucumber blend well to produce a smooth and refreshingly sophisticated cord. It's not the most flattering or 'loud' scent, which makes it perfect for office use. Everyone around you should enjoy it too. Doesn't last extremely long (4-6hrs) , projects close, becomes a skin after about 3 hrs. but it still lingers enough for you to enjoy. I would recommend this scent for Fall, as an office scent or evening scent. Definitely comes across better in the cooler weather. Definitely pick this up and worth the price here!",5
2121,"I love Flower by Kenzo. It is a very original and unique perfume that you can't compare to any others. It is very classy and has a warm, flowery, sweet scent. It is more a winter or evening perfume in my opinion and is a smart casual perfume. I don't use it as an everyday perfume but for evenings with friends. Definitely one of a kind.",5
2121,Love Kenzo flower. It's the perfect balance between flowery and spicy in a gentle way. Very versatile and great value for money. ,5
2121,"Oh my goodness,Kenzo flower is seriously out of this world!! I've been looking for something for my cousin to wear on her wedding day, something that won't trigger her allergies and I believe I've got it. It's so soft,long lasting and utterly feminine,and a great scent for any occasion. I think the edt might be better for her as it's more subtle and I'll be buying the edp for myself. Keeping my fingers crossed in the hope that she loves my pick. ",5
2121,I cannot say enough great things about Kenzo flower. It's a very unique but intriguing scent you can use everywhere in my opinion. I've worn it many years ago and everyone knows me by that scent. It's wonderful to be reacquainted with this beauty again. ,5
2121,If you liked D&G's FEMININE (which has been discontinued) then you will notice a nice resemblance in Kenzo's FLOWER,5
2122,Coty L'aimant reminds me of Chanel 5 but it's much better value. My Mom used to wear it so it's a sentimental favourite.,4
2122,I just love Coty L’aimant perfume..it has been my favourite for many years.. It never fails to draw attention..:),5
2122,"L'Aiment parfum by Coty. Exquisite fragrance, reminds me of my mother. Very light and warm.",5
2122,i have used this scent L'Aimant Coty for years especially to work and when dating in the late 1950's and early 1960's. I love the scent. I could always find it at the kiosks in the malls but I haven't been successful.,5
2122,"This is really pretty. I have never heard of L'Aimant before but it sounded nice and someone described it as a cross between Jovan musk and Chanel #5 and it's true. Very nice and soft, a lotion would be great to make it last longer.",5
2123,"I bought a real L'artisan Parfumeur La Chasse Aux Papillons from the company years ago, and the first I did was to compare the one that I bought from Fragrancenet. As far as I can tell this is the genuine thing. ",5
2123,"L'Artisan Parfumeur La Chasse Aux Papillons is an amazing perfume from a great french perfume house, and I'm forever grateful to Fragrancenet for making it easily available, and (fairly) affordable. I have friends from France who've worn this, and other fragrances from this creator, and I've always been floored by the subtlety, depth, and beauty of the fragrances. This one - La Chasse Aux Papillon - is a heady white floral masterpiece, in that it gives all the sweet, creamy, lushness of Tuberose, Jasmine, and Gardenia, with a fresh,natural approach that defies the usual perfume-y heaviness associated with this kind of scent. It's so sexy, new, and unusual, every time I wear it! You'll get compliments from everyone you know, and some you don't, when you wear this little masterpiece!",5
2123,"Wonderful. Just the best. It's been given to me as a gift by a noble Corsican family, and, I didn't expect to have it become my favourite perfume, since it wasn't chosen by me. I fell in love with it instantly, and it's been my favourite ever since.",5
2123,"If you love Nuxe Prodigieux Le Parfum. This is in the same vein. Humid, but less sticky. ",4
2124,Great fragrance smells good ,5
2124,"Great scent! If you’re into light blue eau intense, or even bora bora exotic, you’ll really enjoy this one ",5
2124,YSL Colonge bleue I like it it’s smells a little sweet it’s actually worth buying ,4
2125,"I have been using Bob Mackie Body Cream for years. It has a wonderful scent and lasts all day. I was so happy when I found it again, I thought it was discontinued. Thank You to Fragrance Net for letting me know it was back!",5
2125,This is the most wonderful scent. I love it and so do my daughters. I bought each daughter the set as part of their Christmas. I bought myself the body cream. I love it. I have worn it for years. ,5
2125,".BOB MACKIE IS SUCH A WONDERFUL SCENT FOR THE PRICE. ALSP DO YOUR REVIEWS AND READ THEM. THEY R HELPFUL. LOVE,LOVE,LOVE IT. ",5
2125,"Another Classic, Mackie has a real spicy scent, has always been a fav of mine. ",5
2126,the best ever everyone asks what you are wearing,5
2128,"Passport to Tokyo smells literally just like D&G light blue, but lasts l onger! So great!!!",5
2128,"I love this fragrance, it's smooth, soft and doesn't clash with my Co workers. ",5
2129,I absolutely love it! I could bathe in it! Took omly a few days for my order to arrive..thank you. I will be ordering more scents for Christmas gifts...i ordered philosophy fresh cream,5
2129,Philosophy Fresh Cream starts out as a very strong vanilla smell. Not for use in close spaces lol. Then it leaves a light scent of vanilla that's very sweet. Has notes of whipped cream as well. ,4
2130, Pink Sugar deodorant by Aquolina I layer with this fragrance as it is a joy to wear. People are always asking what fragrance I'm wearing and telling me they love it!,4
2130,I layer with this fragrance as it is a joy to wear. People are always asking what fragrance I'm wearing and telling me they love it!,5
2132,"My sister sprayed me with this and I had to purchase it for myself. I normally don't go for fragrances that has vanilla or coconut, because the scent tends to not play nice with my body chemistry, but the notes in this mist say otherwise. It works with my body chemistry and I smell delicious!!! That's what I mostly smell, with hints of red berries and plum. Very sexy and sophisticated. It's a stronger scent so I'll only use a few sprays and it will last me the entire day. I'd wear it sparingly during the summertime but I think this scent can work at any time of the year. I feel like this a ""night out"" scent if you want to get noticed ;). ",5
2132,"This scent is absolutely everything I'd expected it to be. Sweet,sexy,feminine and inexpensive. Almost forgot to mention,it's long lasting too. Even teens can use it as well. ",5
2132,"I've always wanted to try Rihanna's fragrances but never got around to doing so. Reb'l fleur is amazing and just like the perfume,the mist lasts a bit longer & much better for my budget. Hope to get the body lotion soon.",5
2133,Symetrie love works best on me. I have tried the other scent's of Symetrie however they didn't go well when I put them on they fade in 10 minutes. ,5

2134,the fragrance lasts with me all day long and with amazing even after I take a shower still smell it that's how strong it is,5
2135,Tous Floral Touch EDT is quite lovely. It is quite similar to Dior's J'Adore but it has better longevity and sillage. This is a very nice fruity floral with a woody/amber base with an amazing sillage.,5
2136,Love this perfume! Suttle and nice!,5
2136,"Buena calidad, buen servicio y rápido",5
2136,Este perfume es algo especial y al precio que lo consegui aqui es mas especial,4

2138,"I get compliments every time I wear Alien! I'm always asked ""what is that?"" Or ""you smell so good"". The first time I sampled it I bought it & have worn it since!!!!",4
2139,"Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Flora Rosa is a light, subtle scent that is perfect for all-over wear in the warm summer months. Not precisely a ""rose"" but a fresh and pretty floral. Does not last long but perhaps that's what best about a summer scent: it doesn't follow you around all day and can be refreshed at any time without overwhelming. I've worn this more than anything else this summer. ",4
2139,Beautiful scent that makes me feel beautiful as well. I love it! I used an entire bottle in just a few months which is new for me. Flora Rosa is one of a kind.,4
2140,"When you walk past a group of people and someone stops you and says ""What is that fragrance you are wearing? It smells wonderful!!!"" Well you know that you have found your perfect fragrance. And for me that is Armani Code. I love it.",5
2140,You wouldn't believe how long I've wanted to try Armani code. Back then as I was in between jobs and school I was on a small budget but with enough savings I finally purchased it and it smells wonderful. I'll definitely buy this again if it comes in the gift set. ,5
2140,Armani Code is an exceptional fragrance good for any time but my preference is evening/after five for that special someone. Love it and receive many compliments and comments when I wear this fragrance. Armani Code is my #1 fragrance. ,5
2141,"Not recommended for those men that are introverted and cant handle being complimented for what sent you are wearing. Every time I wear this total strangers will approach and tell me how good I smell, doesn't matter what season. It last all day and well into the evening, no need to overdue it with applying just a shot or two and you are good, prepare to be approached! ",5

2143,bond-no.-9-i-love-new-york-for-holidays/eau-de-parfum This is a very powerful scent where a little goes a long way.,4
2145,"This reminds me of Autumn nights on Padre Island, bonfire ablaze and the air heavy with salt on a pulsating breeze, tiny crabs running sideways here and there and the shore dotted with seashells like pearls in the sand. The crisp ginger and sweet, juicy quince dance in a unique accord over the depth of the wood and sweetness of the amber in the base. She does remind me vaguely of my husband's Aqva Pour Homme (the shared DNA is quite obvious to my nose) and I love that one, though like someone else has mentioned, the Pour Homme is by far a stronger, larger-projecting fragrance. For this one I suspect the warmer it is outside, the more she will completely unfold and shine. As it is on this cool Spring morning, I am nostalgically transported back to the Gulf Coast shores, surrounded by friends and the gorgeous salted air. Scent: 9/10 probably 10 in warmer temps Performance (longevity): Moderate. Fair enough. Value: Good. No complaints about the price for what I've received in exchange. Sillage: depends largely on application. With 3 sprays, moderate. A small caveat worth mentioning: I oversprayed this once and made myself nauseous so start out with this one cautiously. She is a beauty, though. Just be careful, folks. ♥",5
2145,Bvlgari Aqua Dovina Wow Wow ! I was introduce to this adorable scent by my middle Daughter and immediately i took it over its so me just Fresh and Breathtaking. when i wear it people stop to ask What is it you are wearing . YASSSS it becomes mine forever . Thanks A Thousand. ,5

2162,"Michael Kors Coral; smells good, but does not last long at all. ",5
2162,"Michael Kors Coral is my latest everyday fragrance. I get compliments often & have even given out some free spritzes bc I could tell they Really loved it! Starts out moderate but fades within a few hours (that's why my bottle goes with me); that's the only downside to it. Crisp, citrusy, immediately reminiscent of a sunny summer day. Can't decide if it's grapefruit, bergamot, or both. Either way, it's fabulous!! Then it's got that signature MK sexiness lurking just below the surface. It reminds me a little of Clinique Happy, but more grown-up. Love it!! ",5
2162,"Absolutely love this scent, great for summer. Only complaint is that it doesn't last long.",5
2162,I smelled this perfume at Dillards the other day and I became obsessed with it!! I had to have it! It's a very sweet smell but very different from anything I have (I have a ton!!!) It instantly puts me in a good mood when i put it on. I just wish it lasted longer. ,5

2163,A favorite of mine - light and unusual!,5
2163,"One of my favourite Guerlain scents. It is a classic, old world fragrance that is far better than the later creations by the house of Guerlain. It is versatile, elegant, not overpowering and original. If you like Calèche by Hermès, or Amarige by Givenchy, you will love Mitsouko. (My other favourite Guerlain fragrance is L'Heure Bleue).",4
2163,"Mitsouko is by Guerlain...........not much more needs to be said. It's lovely. It can be worn everyday and to anyplace. It has a bit of an oriental fracrance but again not overtly so. It was introduced right before the roaring twenties and I feel that when I wear it..... That since of things are changing, fun is ahead.......I know a Cole Porter song will have me in it's grips.... Skimming dresses, slacks and blouses. Tap pants and camisoles and the slight breeze that carries a skirt or ruffles a blouse also carries this exotic scent inviting anyone and everyone to join in on all that is special. And something is always special.",4
2165,It is so nice product,5
2165,"Just recently bought the Narciso by Narciso Rodriguez, and I love it!!!!! It's a sweet and spicy scent, that I believe is good enough for year-round use. ;-) It starts off with a sweet, creamy floral and slowly the spice sparkles in to stay forever. ",5
2165,Narciso is the closest scent I have found that remotely smells like Ralf Lauren’s discontinues Tuxedo from the 80’s. This scent is fabulous. It’s rich. Love it.,5
2165,"the edt that stays more than 8 hrs on me. got a lot of complement when i wear this. i was debating on getting this or the white one but due to the budget issue i stick on to this black bottle and im never disappointed. it is woody, musky and rosey. i really like it.",5
2166,Just received this fragrance and it smells nothing like Musk. It smells more like flowers. ,1
2166,"Trying this new perfume, New Musk. I love the fragrance and have only used it once time so far. The bottle presentation is beautiful which complements the beautiful perfume notes. It makes me feel very womanly when I have worn it. Recommend it to those who like Musk, as it stays longer on the body. Just dab on the wrist (do not rub), elbows and on the back of the knees -- then go on a date, dance and the fragrance just seems to go on and on, the reason I love Musk perfumes.",5
2166,This is a beautiful fragrance.... Makes you feel sensual.... Love it.... New musk,5

2214,Very good perfume for men. Stays on you all day. Good buy.,5
2216,Shalimar by Guerlain has been my all time favourite for a long time. Absolutely love the smell of this beautiful fragrance.,5
2216,"My mother wore Shalimar and I started wearing it when I was in college, 1961. It made me feel grown-up and reminded me of home. It did not smell the same on me as on Mother, but both smelled nice. I have used only Shalimar ever since. I hate they discontinued the talc and bath salt. I think I have worn/used every product. Mostly I use spray cologne and body lotion. On vacation once, my granddaughter said to her mother "" I smell Nana!"", but someone else was wearing Shalimar. Happy Woman says she wants buried with a bottle of it, but I think I'd be satisfied with my usual spritz of Shalimar scent to leave people thinking of me.",5
2216,"I started using Shalimar after opening West Edmonton Mall thirty five years ago when the girls In the cosmetics department brought us samples to try. I was hooked and now thirty five years later am still using the perfume, dusting powder, and lotion! Shalimar is awesome! ",5
2216,"SHALIMAR - Shower Gel Got my first Shalimar spray at 15 and haven't used anything else. Didn't wear it for a year or two as it wasn't readily available in my local stores. Shalimar is the scent my husband followed years ago, said it smelled SO enticing he had to find the wearer. 37 plus years later he's still following me. My children remember their grandmother wearing Channel, but me it's Shalimar and they promised to bury a bottle with me, Ha-Ha.",5
2217,IAVE ALWAYS LIKED THE sunflowers from this line so thought I would branch out. This is a very sweet flowery scent that mellows. I really like it but definitely a spring and sunner fragerance.,4
2217,Awesome scent I just love the scent of flowers ,5
2217,I had no idea what this smells like but after smelling it on a friend at a family gathering I knew I had to get mine immediately. Sunflowers dream petals is a very quiet but refreshingly soft fragrance that's perfect for anytime use. I even recommended it to a friend who is a preschool teacher in our neighborhood and she loves it. The kids love it too.,5
2217,I love the fact I can order my favorite perfume online and for a great price! Sunflower perfume and lotion is my fav!♡♡♡,5
2217,"I bought this on a whim, since I love all Elizabeth Arden products I have. I was looking to replace Sunflowers, but am so glad I bought this instead. Such a wonderful fragrance. Not over -powering at all. My son even complimented the fragrance on me. Would recommend to any age group. I'm in my 50's, but can easily see a young woman loving this. So in-expensive, give it a try!",5
2218,"Airy and light , but effective with pleasant smell . Many complements . Sexy smell .",5
2219,Van Cleef in New York. Wonderful scent.I will reorder. ,4

2221,******* PERFECTION FOR ME ******* +ALIEN+ IS MY ALL - TIME FAVORITE - ALL - DAY - PERFECTION - IN - A - BOTTLE ,5
2221,The Alien deodorant is great! I normally spray this all over when I get out of the shower then spray the perfume if I'm going out. The deodorant smells just like the perfume which I love. I also love the convenience of carrying around the deodorant as opposed to the heavy perfume bottle.,5
2221,"Excellent to wear anytime but is especially delightful when used to layer the fragrance. I spray the deodorant on first, then spray the parfum. It always smells heavenly. People ask me what is that divine fragrance you are wearing??",4
2223,MY SON IS SAVING THIS FOR WHEN SCHOOL STARTS TO WEAR THE SCENT IS NICE LAST ALL DAY EVEN WHEN SWEATING STILL SMELLS AWESOME ,5
2223,"The 2 main ingredients, sage & ginger, makes this a very special fragrance. My secret weapon for the ladies here in NY!",5
2225,"I have worn this for years, it's light, a gentle sweet fragrance,never overpowering and I always get compliments, my favorite body cream...",5
2225,Very pleasant any time of the dayHel,5
2225,This is one of the best fragrances I have ever worn and I have been wearing it for 7 years now. Always get compliments and it is not a strong overbearing fragrance. Cashmere Mist is a fragrance you can wear every day.,5
2225,I have always loved the elegance of Cashmere Mist body cream. Love to pair it with the fragrance. This is one of my all time favorites. I hope it stays the same. ,5
2225,I love this scent...it's mild and unique aroma is seductive and not overpowering.,5
2226,"I'm not really keen on celebrity fragrances but this one by Celine Dion is an exception. Pure Brilliance has all the right notes to fit everyone's personal style and as it's inexpensive,you can spray freely without overwhelming those around you. Not too long lasting but not bad either. ",4
2226,"I Like the smell of Pure Brillance,I have ordered it 2 times and I will order this perfume again.I t has a soft smell.I wish the bottle came alittle bigger. It doesn't last as long as I do like.",3
2226,"Celine Dion's pure brilliance fragrance is fantastic. I was looking for the one called notes only to find out that it was discontinued many years ago. This one is very mild and fresh,just great for everyday activities. I even told a good friend's daughter about it when paying them a visit for the new year and she went out & bought two little bottles each for herself & mom.",5
2226,"Love this scent. Pure brilliance is so bright & cheerful,I've used it as an everyday scent and no one had anything negative to say about it. The lotion is also great too. ",5
2226,"I am only 13 and i got this perfume as a birthday gift. My mom says i should smell like a young lady so i tried it and I was very surprised. It smells fresh and fruity,stays quite long on my skin and clothes. I really like it. ",5
2227,"My, my goodness! I'm in love with my body lotion.",5
2227,"Carolina Herrera boy cream smells nice,fragrance doesn't last that long",3
2228,"The chrome deodorant smells and feels great but I dropped it once and the bottom cracked, other then that it’s amazing ",4
2230,"Love this ""Eau de Givenchy"" perfume. I bought this one time at the air port and fell in love with the fragrance. I get complements when I wear it, and that makes me feel good.",5
2230,I wore this perfume and I fell in love...its magical!,5
2230,"Love this perfume, eau de givenchy is delightful and makes me happy. I only wish you sold a larger size, noticed that the mini bottle is the only one on the site.",5
2230,"Incredible jasmine in this one. a Crisp clean classic daily scent. It opens with the sparkling notes of grapefruit, accompanied by sweet and fresh notes of mandarin orange and bergamot, mint and red fruit. The middle notes add luscious and intensive scent of ylang-ylang, honeysuckle, pure jasmine, narcissus, tuberose, lily-of-the-valley, rose, cyclamen and orris root. Base notes introduce warm sandalwood, musk, cedar and oakmoss. Just a beautiful daily scent. Wish Givenchy would bring it back. A classic",5
2230,Eau de Givenchy is is absolutely lovely. Where anywhere any time. I consider it floral as the fruit part is so well balanced that it is hard for me to distinguish. I think it is a magical fragrance. Very feminine without being over the town flowery.,5
2231,"This place s the freshie of the Eau Sauvage line. It’s the best freshie that Dior has. It starts with that great creamy Dior citrus up top with jasmine and Vetiver just behind. It smells very classy/fresh (“summer office” ) at this point but the vetiver fades quickly, stepping WAY back within 45 minutes. That creamy Citrus stays strong and long, well past the vetiver, and at this point it becomes a total freshie. Now it smells like a stronger much longer lasting version of Dior Homme Cologne.",5
2232,"The absolute best scent in the world. I've worn hadrien forever. People ask me all the time ""what are you wearing"" ",5
2232,I wanted to love this as I love bergamot. I do use myself in it and it fades quickly as citrus does. The dry down is hard to detect. It’s lovely but does not last. ,3
2232,hadrien is my fave...love love love ,3
2232,"I ordered a sample of Eau d'Hadrien by Annick Goutal and I love it! The top note smells just like a fresh orange blossom then later it's like I just showered with an expensive perfumed soap, clean and fresh. Will order it again.",5
2232,Just received my sample. I think this is a fun fragrance to try if you like more natural citrusy/woodsy (but more modern and not masculine).fragrances. It is similar to some other Annick Goutal fragrances I've sampled. I feel it is worth getting a sample to try for yourself. It is a little different than many out there. I am interested in trying some of her other fragrances. Still looking for my signature fragrance though...glad I found this site!,4

2236,This is my second bottle of this particular scent. I purchased the 1st bottle from a department store a few years ago. I noticed I was running low and decided to check here for it. The price was unbelievable b/c this is a great Fall/Winter fragrance. It doesn’t require a lot and lasts all day. I would definitely recommend it. ,5
2240,Love this scent . I always get compliments when I'm wearing it. I save it for summer but I could year it yearly!!,5
2240,"My signature scent. I have worn this scent for almost 10 years now. About the middle of the day, I can't smell it on myself anymore, but at the end of the day, I still have people asking me what I'm wearing or commenting that I smell so good. I've never worn a scent that gets so many compliments from men and women. It has a raspberry note in it that lingers wherever you've been. Several of my friends have purchased this scent because I wear it so often and it smells so good. I don't think the perfume smells as good as the pink-ish EDT. ",5
2241,"I have purchased all the mens version....best investment ever, I love smelling good and this(these) are on top shelf lasts all day, compliment all day",5

2243,"My husband recieved a bottle of Lalique for Men many years ago and we both fell in love with the scent. To me (his wife) it has a very sexy scent and I love smelling it on him. It is intense when first applied and then has a subtle sexy scent for the rest of the day that lasts for many hours. I'm not sure how to describe the actual scent! I am so glad that I was able to find this site because it was hard to find, and at a decent price, for the longest time and I thought I would never be able to buy it again. This site has allowed me to purchase several bottles at one time, for almost the price of just one bottle from the high end department stores that I have purchased from in the past. I hope they continue to make Lalique because I'm not sure what he would wear that is as good as this.",5
2243,have been using this fragrance for years thanks to a classy woman very dear and close to me; it is very sexy and I receive a lot of compliments when I wear it; it will define your personality!,5
2244,Lolita Lempicka Mon Eau smells soft and flowery to me. Nothing like the bath and body works stuff either so its not offensively strong but not too long lasting either. I happen to like it enough to recommend it because I get migraines often and this one is just something I can tolerate. ,5
2245,Used this in my early 20's and was so happy to find it again. My family loves it when I wear this scent.,5
2245,"I have used this fragrance for years and always get compliments on. My husband even tried the dusting powder, said he just wanted to see how it was'. ",5

2246,"I have been using this brand of products for about a year and a half. This is the first time I tried the shower soap and I really like it, it lathers great and leaves on a clean wonderful scent. I would recommend it to try it and see if you like it. That is what I did and I was glad I did.",5
2246,"Maja Shower Gel has a good, clean fragrance without being overpowering. It lathers very well and leaves your skin feeling moisturized.",5
2247,ok the truth in my personal opinion this perfume is too sweet for me so I had to give it to someone else because I too sweet for is very sweet that some for reason it gave me a headache.,3
2247,"No soy amante de los perfumes dulces, pero Roses Vanille by Mancera es una delicia de perfume, siempre que uso hay alguien que me pregunta por mi perfume. Simplemente rico, además que dura horas y horas!!!",5

2256,"Nisean by PDM is not what I expected, really solid fragrance absolutely underrated. Sample first but if ur a PDM fan this one is a great fragrance!! It’s is a masculine fragrance that is rich, pretty diverse fragrance. Longevity is a little better than average. ",4

2261,Unbreakable Love by Khloe & Lamar is a nice scent....my daughter said it kinda has a masculine smell and it kinda does but then it dries to a more feminine scent crazy but I Love It !!!!! You can really wear it anywhere at anytime. Any age...I would definitely recommend for Female's not Male's..I think the overall scent after it dries down a hint of Citrus..Cedar... Spice.,5
2264,I have a question to still perfume smell like the flower lily of the valley ,4
2264,"Woods of Windsor Lily of the Valley. It's quite pleasant and light, but I had hoped for a stronger scent. My mother used to get Lily of the Valley from Ann Haviland, which is not around more. I loved that fragrance, but this is not very similar.",3
2264,Lily of the valley smells so refreshing.,5
2266,Its a lemony citrus scent that is very faint. Projection is more of a skin scent and longevity was less than an hour. I recieved Banana Republic M as a christmas gift. Personally i dont really use it much.,1

2271,"I just love the scent of Charlie Silver. I recently attended a friend's father's funeral and they picked me to read the bible passage while my friend does the eulogy. It was quite a hot day & in a hurry to get things over with,she forgot to put some fragrance on. I quickly gave her a few sprays of silver and she was able to make it through the service. We also got a lot of hugs & compliments about it. She then said once she's over her grief,she will be buying herself a bottle or two of Charlie Silver as she calls it her 'New beginnings fragrance.'",5
2271,"I never liked the scent of the original Charlie because some family members I know wore it at some point in time and a few of them have passed on,so for me, it triggers nothing but sad memories. But with Charlie silver,it's very different. I love the calm soothing effect it has on me and since it's within my budget range,I will definitely buy this again in a heartbeat. Hope they won't ever take it off the shelves.",5

2271,Did not like this smell although I tried it was too sweet,1
2272, Chloe Fleur De Parfum eau de parfum spray 2.5 oz & body lotion 3.4 oz & eau de parfum .17 oz mini by Chloe . I ordered the gift set and had it wrapped as a gift also.

So, I read reviews, and more reviews, then I ordered it. I do not regret it one bit. It smells so clean, refreshing & at the same time a little mysterious. Ladies, try it, you will not regret it. Great price, too. ",5
2274,Dancing...by Jessica McClintock is my absolute favorite perfume!! I am always getting compliments about how good I smell whenever I am wearing it! I’m so happy to have found it here because this I looked everywhere and this is the only place I found it so please keep it in stock so I can continue getting it!,5

2277,"Emporio Armani Diamonds is my favorite scent of all time. Great smell, long lasting!",5
2277,This fragrance caught me by surprise I must say. I like how it has just enough pop to it to attract attention. When they said it is moderate fragrance I must agree with them on this one. It truly is for a mature person. ,4

2278,"Perfect scent for almost every occasion, (eternity now)",5
2279,"Blind buy, and my first fantasy fragrance by Britney. The Naughty Remix is quite lovely, and sure I’d say a sexy scent. Not too many notes for any sort of depth but it does the trick. Sweet, sugary, powdery, and very woody. I actually smell like s’mores over a campfire is what I get. Definitely be prepared for the campfire part. I personally would only wear this in the evening or more during fall/autumn. I don’t see this being wearable for daytime wear or even summer at all. Overall I do like it. ",4
2279,Fantasy the naughty remix is one of my favorite of the fantasies!,5
2279,"I bought a bottle of Fantasy the Naughty Remix when I was in Australia in late Jan/early Feb on the basis that I could smell chocolate! For me, it is somewhat spicy initially but it does die down somewhat. I've gotten a lot of compliments about this perfume and will definitely purchase it again!",5
2279,"I love it, I get compliments all the time!!",5
2283,Inspire by Ellen Tracy did not inspire me. I dislike the scent.,1
2283,I luv this Inspire. It smeels soooo gooood. Try it.,5
2283,I luv this Inspire. It smeels soooo gooood. Try it.,5
2283,I DON'T LIKE THIS AS WELL AS OTHERS I BOUGHT. THE SCENT IS SUBTLE AND HARD TO DISCERN,5
2283,I loved this. not too flowery or heavy.,5
2285,"I love Jardin de Bagatelle! It may seem to be best fitting for a more mature woman but I get numerous beautiful comments about it from all age groups. The finishing scent is powdery, lightly floral yet warm. This is one of those fragrances that you keep reaching for even when you would have preferred to put on a different scent from time to time.

2285,I have loved this perfume for 40 years. ,5
2285,"Surfers Paradise Australia I have been using this beautiful perfume"" Jardins de Bagatelle ""since it was lunched in 1983. Have always received wonderful comments, like here is the lady with the magnificent Perfume, Love it and never wear anything else......God bless Guerlain.",5
2285,Jar dibs de Bagatell Wonderful ,5
2285,"Did not like this one at first. I sprayed it, and another on my arms and my boyfriend picked this one. He said it was okay. I wasn't sure...so I sprayed it on for work. Throughout the day I would catch whiffs of it and say, what is that, it smells good; then I'd realize it was my perfume. It is hard to describe the scent. It is sweet and smoldery. It dries down to a delicate subtle scent that is very nice. I think I will keep it for work. Everyone complains about my Ralph and other flower scents I wear. Makes them sneeze (because they don't make them like the original version anymore). This one however, I did not get any complaints, and it doesn't announce you when you walk in the room. It is more like, what is that nice scent, is that you? I am pleased with the ddry-down of this perfume and have decided to keep it.",4
2286,Love this Perfum!!!! Very sexy ... last a long time on my skin ,5
2288,"I, fortunately, found a nearly full tube that I am using, rather than the Illicit which I am so unhappy about. Although the scent is similar, the consistency and duration of the Illicit does not measure up to the loveliness of the Jimmy Choo that I have purchased and enjoyed for many years. Until some recourse is offered to me I feel I am stuck with the inferior product.",3
2288,"I've order the Jimmy Choo perfume and I love it. The smell is soft and unique. Even when you don't smell it others do. I've been asked by many men and women "" what are you wearing?""",5
2288,I liked Jimmy Choo but it is not my favorite.,3
2288,This is the best fragrance!! ,5
2288,"I have looked and looked for a new fragrance for a very long time. Even if I thought something smelled nice, it often did not on me.

2291,"oh what a treat! classic . on the sweet side but with the oriental nose that is not longer replicated in todays' frags. if you like Champs Elyssees and Samsara, you will like this, L'instant sits between those two wonderful Guerlain",5
2291,Sweet-smelling flowery fragrance that doesn't smell like a teenager - it's a sophisticated sweet that isn't clawing. I would agree that it's flowery + oriental. Good lasting power. ,5
2292,"La Petite Robe Noire Black Perfecto is gorgeous!!! I love Guerlain fragrances. This is a beautiful deep, dark, sweet/syrupy scent that last quite a long time on the skin. The bottle is beautiful and really fits the scent.",5

2294,"I bought this for my sons (ages 9 and 5) and this is one of the best colognes I have ever purchased. It is a wonderful balance of musk and fresh fruit without the over powering sweet after math. It is a cologne for active men...and of course, school age boys that play outside and sweat half of the day! Lol...now I don't have to worry about my kids smelling like sweat and fear....oh and a hint of daycare diapers! I have purchased them 3 cologne scents from Thallium, Mambo...for men of course...Angel Pure Shot, Curve, and Kenneth Cole reaction since they were born and this one is MY personal favorite!",5

2296,"I wanted a signature fragrance I could wear on my trip to Paris that would remind me of my trip each time I wear it. Fragrances trigger memories for me and are an important part of my life. Miu Miu L'Eau Bleu is now part of my permanent fragrance collection. I love the floral scent. This will always be my ""Springtime in Paris"". ",5
2296,A very creative fragrance and worth a repurchase... and in case anyone doesn't know Miu Miu is owned by Prada. There is a woody note in the fragrance that smells a bit peppery which combines with pretty floral (lily I think). Moderate longevity and sillage on me. Great deal on Fragrance Net. ,5
2296,"Miu Miu L'Eau Bleue. Nice and fresh. First spray comes on strong but dries to a nice clean floral. Am not fond of heavy, powdery or cloying fragrance. This is neither. Prefer not to have fragrance enter before myself or leave a scent trail, however, spray enough and it can become strong. A little or a lot. You decide. For me a dab will do it. Will purchase again and recommend",4
2296,I love this perfume and fantastic! Thanks for FragnanceNet and I'll stick to your company whenever needed perfume for my self or gifts ! BEST price and professional delivery are thums up ! I love this company! ,5

Was happy with my purchase, and the fact that FragranceNet carries both the original and revamped bottle styles.",5

2308,"Silver shadow is created by Francis Kurkdjian, who also authored Armani mania. Forget what the ingredients say, what this smells like is vanilla, mild woods, and metal. I haven't found a person man or woman who has not liked the way it smells. It is smooth, long lasting, and elegant.",4
2308,Description was citrusy. I did not sence any citrus. Strong cinnamon/vanilla scent. Nice but not what I thought it would be. Still will wear it.,3

2309,Quite possibly my favorite cologne for the winter! You will not go wrong with this one!,5

I found his cologne in a shop and when we got home found a few of other testers including spicebomb extreme.. let's just say that on our trip to the UK we found the bottle and purchased it! His new favourite cologne! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's 20+. It has that mature scent, but still wearable for the 20 something. It lasts for days! He will spray it directly onto his chest, about two squirts and it goes through his t-shirt and onto his sweater... that I would wear the next day hah. It's a really good product for the price! ",5
2309,"Spicebomb Extreme is a long lasting, manly scent that is warm and inviting. It's my new favorite scent to wear. To give an idea of what scents I usually wear, I also wear Angel for Men and Pi for men.",5

2312,"Vanderbilt shower gel BY Gloria Vanderbilt I love this shower gel, the fragrance is not overwhelming. ",5
2312,"I know about Vanderbilt the perfume growing up because that's the signature scent of my late aunt,and a couple of teachers in school wore it too. The shower gel is very relaxing and a bit foamy so I sometimes use it when I run out of ordinary soap. Will buy some more very soon along with the perfume & lotion.",5
2313,"Secret charm is so lite smelling, I love it.",5
2313,"Ooh,I love this scent. It's a very pleasant but gentle scent you can use everywhere. Great price too. I wholeheartedly agree with nubianqueen's review below,whatever ingredients they used to make this lovely potion,it makes me feel my absolute best,and yes I believe there's a lotion too,so I'll be getting that right away. Charming indeed. ",5
2313,"Secret charm is one seriously gorgeous fragrance mist. I chose the romantic category for it because that's how I think a lady should smell if she's looking out for that special someone. I also love weddings & I think this will be perfect for the bride to wear. I wish I knew what kind of notes went into the making of this fragrance,perhaps some white flowers with a hint of citrus maybe? I wonder if there's a lotion too,that would make this a great combo for my money's worth. Nevertheless,a truly 'charming' fragrance by Victoria's Secret. ",5
2314,"Wow this fragrance is stunning and delicious! The title of the fragrance speaks for itself, smoke and oud. It’s a woody oriental. It has the right balance of sweet, smoke and incense. The oud and rose are definitely prominent but in a masculine formulation. There’s some spice, amber and tonka in the dry down. A fall and winter scent. Great for a date night or for a special event too. Not sure I would wear it to the office. Love this one!",5
2314,"I smelled this fragrance while i was on vacation and couldn't wait to get home to order it on Fragrancenet. Much better price for a very unique, masculine, fresh and musky scent. the Oud fades after about two hours, but the dry down is excellent. I would recommend this to any serious fraghead.",5
2314,Excellent Scent was gonna buy the Oud.....but took a chance on this .....very impressed!,5

2316,"Vol DE Nuit is a lovely fragrance. My only complaint is the lack of longevity in the EDT. I wish Guerlain made an EDP, as the pure extract is a bit pricey for me.",4
2316,My favorite scent for decades! Where can I get the refill bottle?,5
2316,"Have worn it since my prom although not exclusively. Today, I wear it during the day, everyday, subtle and classy. As always, Guerlain..",5

2319,"Shades Wood - Batch # 231988. Simply incredible. Very mystical strange scent that lasts 4-6 hours. In my barber shop I hand the bottle and say smell.....And always its like they smell it 10 times and still can't figure it out. Its one you have to have in your collection. Some say its a gasoline opening, or perhaps pipe tobacco or Tangerine. You will smell this bottle many many times trying to figure it out. Buy this one. Sauvage EDP, SpiceBomb Intense, CDIM, Valentino, YSL nuit intense, many Ed Hardys, Joop, OUD oils etc....",5
2319,Armaf Shades Wood is spectacular! It reminds me of my wealthy Uncle’s cherry tobacco pipe smoke. This scent lasts for hours. Heaven! ,5

2328,D&G 14 La Temperance is one of my favorites!! It’s light and mild so if you easily get headaches from strong smells then this one is a great way to go. I love it for everyday wear it’s clean and sweet! I wish there were more than just sample size available.,5
2328,"D&G 14 LA Temperance has a very slight scent-would make a great gift for a young teen just starting to enjoy wearing cologne. This fragrance I would not recommend for women looking for a lasting aroma. It has no staying power for a woman on the go, because after the first mist it is a miss and go.",1
2329,"My wife and I discovered Dalisimme when worn by a cruise ship cocktail waitress in 1996, and were only able to find it in the Caribbean for several years. FN has made it affordable for many years since, and it is still my favorite of all perfumes. We keep many on hand, as it is a treasured gift.

2369,Del Mar is a woodsy scent that is very masculine. It's one of my favorite colognes that I will buy again. It's a great go to scent that is clean and a slightly spicy. There are several notes working together to create this great experience. ,5
2370,"Very strong manly scent. Strong wood ,spice,pepper smell. The reviews didn't explain very much other than a cedar notes. . Those are there also. Pretty strong when sprayed on .then lightens up shortly after. . I would buy again. ",4

2372,"Brooklyn is a highly adored by others when you wear. The scent, not to strong will leave everyone around you wanting to know what you have on! I love this scent and it last forever on your body. From the minute you put it on till you go to bed you get whiffs of it. I love this and recommend any of the Bond #9 scents. ",5
2372,"Very unique. Hated it at first, but then found it to be wonderful. Certainly for the person who does not want to smell like everybody else. The only problem is that it does not have good longevity. But I love the fragrance. ",5
2372,"Okay. This is a scent you will probably not like at first blush. However, spray 3 times and wait 30 minutes. The smell is very unique, attractive, and good. Neither a sweet smell or overly spicy, Brooklyn is perfect for the person who does not want to smell like anyone else. At first I hated it, now I absolutely love it. Be unique and try it. ",5
2375,Chloe New Lotion perfume is my favorite scent. I get a lot of compliments from both men and women. It smells like a hint of Roses. ,5

2376,"This is my most favourite perfume ever and has been for a couple of years now. It’s really good if you are one of those people that don’t really like flowery strong scents but prefer something unique with scents of Wasabi, Mandarin & Violet Leaf.

2378,Great product. Delivered quickly.,5
2379,"Its hard to pin down this scent with a classification. I just love it! Its such a soft, feminine scent. Its soft, tasteful, not to floral, and almost a soft musk element. Its perfect for me (at 48) and soft enough for a young girl as well. It doesnt last long though, but most cheaper fragrances dont. I really like it though, so i just reapply a couple times a day. However, I never fail to get many compliments when i do wear it!",4
2380,"I love it, very long lasting ",5

She bought two bottles of this eau de Giorgio for herself and she always smells great wherever she goes,but what I did not know is that she kept an extra one hidden away just for me!!! I was so happy she did,because I can't stand borrowing anything,even perfume from my mom or sisters & since it's inexpensive,this will motivate me to save and get my own no matter how long it takes.",5
2381,I ordered the Giorgio liked it so much I ordered a second bottle . Didn't want to run out . I love the smell it is so fresh smelling. I wear it every day. Years ago I wore it now I have come back to it. Love it. Very good Company to order from.,5

2391,"L'Artisan Parfumeur Rappelle-Toi is my holy-grail perfume. I have two large bottles and thinking about getting a third so I never run out. The official notes are gardenia, Sichuan pepper, musks, sandalwood, and honey, which sounds vaguely foodie, however the florals are center so you will not think you're in a kitchen. The mood of the perfume is supposedly contemplative and quiet. Well, not on me! This perfume is spirited, happy, fun, my ""going out"" perfume -- flirty but not musky or skanky (there's a time and place for big skanky perfumes, no shade, this just isn't that). It's weird enough to hold my attention (I have like 400+ perfumes), but pretty enough that I don't feel like I'm shutting out the people around me (unlike, say, Dzing, with it's wonderful but um challenging animalistic notes). For whatever reason, almost every perfume designed by Bertrand Duchaufour seems to work with my body chemistry, but not in the way he (claims) he intended. ",5
2392,"I just recieved this wonderful fragrant powder. I love it so much, I ordered 8 packets! I wore this perfume back in the 90's and never saw it again afterwards! This is by far, one of my favorite fragrances. Please please please, bring back the perfume! Not only I, but many other women would order it! It would be by far, one of, if not the best sellers out of all your fragrances!",5
2392,Please bring back the L’Effleur Perfume. I love the smell & got so many compliments when I put it on. Please if you don’t bring it back tell us where we can get it. Mary Venable. ,5
2392,"OMG, I love L'EFFLEUR, I always wore the perfume about 20 years ago and then all of a sudden I couldn't find it anymore. I have been looking for this for years and still looking thats how I came across this powder. Please, please, please bring back the perfume. I use to turn heads when I would wear the perfume, lol. It smells sooooo good. I am going to order the powder and I am am going to keep looking for the perfume. LOVE IT!!!",5
2392,"I love this fragrance! You MUST bring back the perfume. I used to wear it as a young girl when my mother first bought it for me. She bought it for me every year. This perfume is sooo classic, sooo soft, feminine and clean smelling. Its shame you stop making this. I would love to get the perfume for my daughter. Classic traditions should never end.",5
2392,"I love L'EFFLUER powder by Coty. I'm paralyzed in a wheelchair and I have 2 be on bed rest ALOT. So bed bath's have become part of my life. This is wonderful, I wash up as usual then sprinkle some of this on my wash cloth. It's awesome, I smell wonderful, as if I just got out of the bath.",5

2393,Excellent scent. Arrived fresh and perfect. Great deal.,5
2393,"I have all the Juliette Has a Gun fragrances - and all are wonderful. I am not a fan of florals, but this is an exception-the patchouli keeps it in check and makes for a fabulous floral/woodsy scent. ",5
2393,Thank you fragrancenet for bringing Lady Vengeance back! Oh how I've missed you! This is an elegant and sexy perfume. Always get compliments whenever I wear it! ,5
2394,I bought the fragrance for my wife due to the fact that I knew someone years ago that wore it. I is just the same as I remember. It still smells great.,5
2394,"Salvador Dalí's Laguna not only smells good. It smells HAUNTING. You do have to wait a few minutes, and then you will be enchanted. Problems? The obvious. Not particularly strong, and little staying power. Buy many bottles, and drench your clothes. it is inexpensive. So worth it anyway. Very much unisex.",4
2394,Excellent perfume !! very striking !!,5
2395,"Love2Love - Orange Blossom This perfume is very light and so refreshing, appropriate for Spring and Summer and of course the price is good (very reasonable!). I made a good choice in buying this Perfume LoveLove. Maria Rennard",5
2395,This fragrance is the closest thing to a perfume that I loved years ago. It was absolutely love and cherish what I have. It came in pretty quick. A++++++company!!,5
2397,Daisy Dream is a pleasant very feminine scent that is so light I can only smell it for 10 minutes max. I have had more staying power with rose water and at over $60 for a small bottle I am very disappointed.,1
2397,I also ordered daisy dream kiss also smells wonderful no problems I would recommend this perfum company to anyone.,5
2398,"This is a classic! Wonderful smell I mean wonderful. I get complemented all the time when worn. Unless you got a old bottle, u can not say this perfume stinks you just can not say it.",5
2398,Miss Boucheron is beautiful. The scent Is clean and refreshing. I love it. One of my top perfumes. Very unique scent. ,5
2398,Miss boucheron is the worst perfume I've encountered in a long time. I love perfume. I order from here regularly and never disappointed until I got this. It smells like it's turned bad. Avoid it! This site is good this perfume is disgusting!,5
2398,Miss Boucheron STINKS! I don't know if it's supposed to smell this bad but it smelled like it had spoiled. Totally disgusting. I won't put it on a cow in a barn it was that horrible! There are so many other beautiful fragrances out there. This is money in the toilet and probably the best place for this garbage.,5
2398,Miss Boucheron doesn't have the violet scent I was hoping for. It is a nice fragrance but I am only disappointed because I was looking for something with heavy violet scents. The container is nice and the price was right. Shipping was prompt.,5
2401,I started using opium I'll just toilette or eau de perfume and body lotion about 40 years ago LOL! Between that and the original Tiffany for summer I've been so happy. The lotion provides remarkable softness. I recommend all opium products highly.,5
2401,"OPIUM EDT combined with the body lotion and bath gel makes a woman feel fresh, feminine, and ""fetching"" throughout the day/night. Redheads have to refresh during the course of the day because we don't absorb fragrance as well as brunettes. I have requested OPIUM EAU DE PARFUM for several months, but my request has not been honored as yet.",5
2403,Nothing special with this fragrance but I would not purchase again. I would go back to Ralph blue instead of trying to get out cheaper. ,3

2404,Philosophy’s Sea of Love is addicting! I love Pure Grace and this is rivaling it. It is a summery scent and I have people asking what I am wearing that smells so good every time I wear it.,5
2404,"All Philosophy products are terrific! If you have never tried them, you are missing out. I get compliments on all of the fragrances I put on. It truly is a a fresh experience. ",5
2404,Sea of love= ADDICTIVE ,5
2404,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!,5
2404,"Philosophy, ""Sea of Love"" is a gloriously soft refreshing perfume. No matter when I wear it. people will ask me what I am wearing that smells so good. It also always reminds one of a light summer night. Just the very best. This is the only place that I can find it now. ",5
2405,"I love this fragrance & the lotion added helps it too last longer. You can also wear the lotion by it self. It is light, airy & feminine.",5
2405,I have used Prada for a few years and would recommend it to anyone. The lotion in itself is about all you need but a little spray helps also. I get compliments all the time on how good the Prada smells.,5
2406,Each and EVERY time I wear this fragrance I am complimented by ALL age groups!!! I've had men write the name down so they could be certain to purchase for their mates asap. This is a smell that several friends have asked to be gifted as an occasion seems fit. Lol! I wore it daily but have since times it down as I began feeling like the pied piper of perfume. She Wood is DEF in my top 3 scents. Perfect pricing here as well. Thanks ,5
2406,Smells great. I love it.,5
2406,"I love SheWood, it is a little woodsy but fresh. Not overpowering, and a great fragrance to wear every day. I have had complete strangers ask me what I am wearing, it is just a fantastic scent.",5
2406,"I love She Wood! Instantly, I fell in love when I first sampled it years ago. Very soft and sensual. I love anything that's woodsy and unique. She Wood definitely fits the bill!!! Keep this in stock forever and I'll be a faithful customer!!!!!!!!",5
2406,I was introduce to this fragrance by a friend who was in Canada about 6 years ago and have been hooked. It is very sensual and not overpowering at all. I always get comments on how it smells. This is a keeper!!! ,5
2407,"Swiss Army- Mountain Water is a lovely fragrance for all ages. If you are looking for a scent that will put a smile on your heart, the first spray, you will not be disappointed with it. Love it. I have used it for more than five years.",5
2407,"When I ordered Swiss Army Mountain Water, I didn't notice that it was meant for women. As a man, I tried it anyway when it arrived and I saw it was ""for her."" It is a light fragrance but not specifically feminine; I'd call it uni-sexual. ",3
2408,I love the unisex perfume cologne unbreakable bond by Khloe and Lamar. I have been using this for the last 4 or 5 years it's one of my favorite unisex smells ever. I just wish it would come in a slightly bigger bottle to last me a little longer LOL I will continue to purchase this product as long as you sell it thanks,5
2408,"My husband and I both wear this, so yummy and people always ask what it is. Not too expensive. A must buy! I ordered a bottle and they sent me a gift box ....awesome! Fragrancenet you rock!",5

2408,Unbreakable Bond is amazing. The scent last for hours. Receive compliments every time I wear. The service with Fragrance Net was quick and very professional.,5
2409,"Oud fragrances are a preference of mine. Ungaro III Oud turned out to be the winner amongst the 3 fragrances i purchased. This fragrance at first,seemed slightly heavy on the vetiver top note...AT FIRST. But,as the time passed....all notes struck a very pleasant balance that is predominated by that true and soothing ""woodsy"" yet lightly sweet Oud essence. This is a good fragrance for the price. ",5
2409,"Great experience. This is my second time buy of this fragrance. I loved it , I just wish it last little long on me. ",4
2409,"I ordered the tester of the ungaro pour oud III for my husband , it was a blind buy. Damn did it arrive and I fell in love with it. I'm a Oud lover cos I'm from the middle East. This perfume is a mild type of Arabian oud perfumes that can be worn everyday,unlike the concentrated ouds that are meant for special classic occasions. This also blends well when mixed with other perfumes. It's strong but not overpowering. Manly, but very sexy too . I realky wanna stock up on this. I love it",5
2411,"First time I use it and I love it, very good like the person who has sensitive skin and senses. ",5
2411,Victoria Secret Love parfum smells wonderful! Receive a lot of compliments when I wear this parfum!!! The price is affordable and shipped in a timely manner! ,5
2414,"I just bought this fragrance-Adidas(Victory League) for my daily use,along with-Angel Men (Pure Malt) for my occasional use,i realized there was no review on this product,and i felt bad that how many people are missing on the smell of this product,and i am sure why because its really really cheap fragrance,but to be honest don't go on the price of this thing,it smells unique different than most of the fragrances,it is subtle not strong neither a light smell,it has dry fruity smell to it its hard to explain along with musk,pear,basil and fresh cut grass,the combination smells satisfying in some sort of way,i would recommend to anyone to give it a try,you wont be disappointed,the only reason it is cheap is because of it's longevity it only sticks around for hardly 4-5 hours,you'll still be able to smell it on your skin all day long but after 4 hours you'll have to stick your nose on the spots you sprayed it on, i like fragrances, i have tried a lot of them from cheapest to expensive ones, i don't mind spending my money on body fragrances at all so i actually am a experienced fragrance user. its good for any season or weather cos it has both warm along with the freshness to it UNEXPLAINABLE!!! but GOOD!!! ",5
2416,I simply love ANYWAY! Matter of fact it’s the only perfume I ever wear! Usually when I start getting low I reorder since it’s all that I use. This time I messed up thinking the bottle had more in it than I thot now I’m freaking out becoz I have to wait till I get my reorder!! I do wish there were a lotion and body powder that you could layer it with. It seems to be one of those perfumes that after having it on a bit u cant smell it but everyone else can. I like that the small lasts!,5
2416,I love anyway so much.. it is perfect! Smells just like the sampler!,5
2416,This scent is amazing I got so many compliments wearing it.. My fiancé definitely approved.. it can be pricey but worth it only downside is I wish it lasted longer.,5
2417,"Love this! Armaf Tag Her has a very fresh/clean scent and is the perfect fragrance for hot summer weather. If anyone is familiar with the Iso E Super fragrance molecule, I feel that this note is pretty prominent on the dry down, so if you like the qualities of Iso E Super, you will most likely enjoy Tag Her.",5
2417,"Thank You AlbaLaura for you review, it was the biggest key to buy AMFAR TAG-HER EDP.",5
2417,"AMFAR TAG-HER EDP 3.4 oz. This one of the best buy I ever had, and the reason of buying this EDP, is because I read ALBALAURA review about this nice fragrance, so I told myself ‘ it isn’t expensive at all, so if I didn’t like it I just give it to someone who does ‘ not a big deal, and I was excited when arrived and try it, and the essence smell SO GOOD that I felt so happy, every time that I wear it, I get so many compliments, and of course, they ask where did I bought it. I am known as the Parfum Lady ! They thought that it was a very expensive parfum, because I always wear parfum where ever I go, they also thought that I paid a fortune. I was pretty upset because when I received and tried, wanted to buy more, so I went to the website and everyone was sold, I got so upset, and today to my Biggest Surprise they got it again, so I just bought enough to last me for while.",5
2417,I love it Armf tag her . Very soft fragrance. ,5
2417,"Armaf - Tag Her. i have worn D&G light blue for the longest during the summer, the only thing that it lacked is the lasting power. This smells just like Light Blue!! I sprayed Tag Her on before work in the morning around 9am and when i got home at 7pm i still smelled it on me. With Light Blue I maybe get a few hours. And for the price..... cant beat it! BETTER in every way! ",5

2420,Just what I expected. Love the fragrance. It makes me feel pretty every time I wear it. I get a lot of compliments also.,5
2422,Sunset in Salina is a bit disappointing. To me it smells like string bug spray. I thought I would be getting a warmer version of the original light blue. I won't repurchase. It'll be a while before I finish the bottle. ,2

2423, Dior Sauvage Very Cool Spray BY Christian Dior ,5
2425,"Wow, this one incredible value and no one seems to have heard of it. FC is smells similar to AQVA BVLGARI will a faint addition powder and orange peel. It's lasting power close to is as well. I'd say you get an easy 7 hours maybe longer. I sprayed a piece of paper yesterday and it is still going strong 24 hours later. AQVA is the better scent, but at this price around $10 dollars. I am considering making the switch For the unbelievable value I am giving it 5 stars. ",5

I received this in the sample size, and this is my favorite out of all the ones I purchased! Once I applied it: I was immediately lifted up, and captured by the intoxicating beauty of this scent. It's woody and sweet with very subtle notes of coconut and a nice white floral backdrop that gives it a feminine edge.

",5
2443,"Monsieur Givenchy is both my husbands and my favorite scent. I've been buying this for him for years and have not found another scent that is as nice. One of the few that you have to get close to smell, not overwhelming as some are. Nothing worse than walking into a room and smelling someone that has already left but their strong scent remains.

This is my favorite fragrance. I love the fact that I can buy the after shave balm, the shower gel and the cologne together. The price with the discount is also a plus for me. ",5
2452,Reb'l fleur is a fantastic fragrance. The sheer spray is better than I thought it would be and the price could not be beat. I'd certainly recommend this if you're looking for a fragrance that fits within your budget & is wearable all year long.,5
2452,"This scent from Rihanna is absolutely breathtaking. I feel like I'm on vacation in the tropics,lying on one of those beach chairs and just relaxing by the beach. Reb'l Fleur captures those elements of the islands perfectly,in my opinion. I will certainly buy this again.",5
2452,"Love,love love Reb'l fleur it's amazing and long lasting too. I don't see much of a difference between the original & the sheer spray but I wish they'd bring back the body lotion. Great for all occasions,so don't limit yourself to just one. Buy the entire combo if you wish,including the body mist. You're guaranteed to smell great and get your money's worth. Happy smelling!!!",5
2453,Rogue man by rhianna is nice. I always steal from him too. Its kool. Thumbs up,5
2453,Even at this inexpensive price it’s not worth it.....very feminine fragrance....regret buying this fragrance ,2

2454,Royall Muske is the only scent my husband will wear since discovering it over a decade ago. He gets compliments all the time. Even from his male friends : ) I guess that says it all!,5
2454,"This cologne has been around since the 1950's and I can see why now. Royall Muske has a regal smell to it ... classy and very mature. It has a deep and somewhat comforting smell. It has a musk smell, but it's like no other musk I've smelled. It simply smells of royalty. I bought it for my husband and I'm super glad now. I think this is going to become his signature smell.",5
2454,This is absolutely the best male cologne there is!,5
2454,"I LOVE this fragrance! I bought it for my boyfriend, and when he wears it I can't get enough! Not overpowering, just plain yummy!",5
2456,"Sira Des Indes is an unusual scent. When it first goes on it smells odd, and slightly chemical, but this evaporates and the scent shifts considerably over the time you wear it. After it dries down for a half hour it smells chocolaty, floral and spicy with some musk. I am usually not a musk fan, though it does give this scent a richness. This is a scent some will adore and others will find unappealing. It is here for a real bargain--I bought it blind because the house is so famous. It's not really me but I will wear it since I think it has originality and class.",4
2456,"This is such an incredible find. Simply beautiful, soft, warm, creamy, feminine and sexy. A little sweet, a little floral, a little fruity, and a little woody - not too much of anything and blended seamlessly. It has vaulted to the top ranks of my favorite perfumes. I plan on buying backups, because I need this to always be in my collection.",5
2456,"Sira Des Indes is unique. Initially, I thought I had made a mistake in purchasing it, but through wearing it often and learning to appreciate the unique scent, it has grown on me. It literally smells like nothing else in my large collection. Floral, musk, green, a hint of fruit and some lactones. It is perfectly fine for office or casual wear. It is not a powerhouse scent, in fact it is very light unless purposefully heavily applied. It is beautiful on a hot summer day!",4
2456,Very sexy and worth exploring...you will enjoy!,4
2456,"Sira Des Indes - if you are looking for Industrial Strength fragrance, that will not fade by the end of your first coffee in the morning.....this is it. And very unique. Most fragrance in the US is light floral, sweet floral, or powdery. Not this one. It has an exotic essence that will probably take some getting used to, but once it sets....it's very descriptive of the person wearing it...just by the smell. I love it. ",4
2457,I am in love with Preppy Princes BUT this is even better. It os so prettttttty!!!!!,5
2457,"Lovely package, soft, gentle, feminine scent. ",5

2461,Alien Oud Majestueux. I purchased the sample size and will definitely order the larger size. It’s oriental mixed with the (purple Alien). Great combination especially if you’re into fragrances with Oud. ,5
2461,"I bought the vile before getting the actual size and all I can say is that I love it. It too has a sophisticated smell to it. A lot more mature then Alien and of course, is a mature fragrance. I will be purchasing this one as well.",5
2462,"Love it, wish they had an aftershave also.",5
2462,Perry Ellis America all time favorite get lots of compliments from both women and men scent last 6 to 10 hrs 3 sprays is all it takes ,5
2462,"America is one of my favorite colognes. It has a scent that is hard to describe, but is not heavy or offensive. to me, it just smells clean. Leaves a very pleasant after scent. The scent lasts for hours, and is just so enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone, for any purpose. I love it so much that i spray it on my pillow cases!",5
2463,"Love this fragrance! Tried it on a whim, have always purchased high end department store fragrances and this was a lovely surprise. A woody floral that's soft and long lasting. No fancy bottle but affordable and pleasant.",4

2467,"When i purchased High Line, it said it was unisex, but i see here it's listed as a women's fragrance. I get a ton of compliments from both genders (even genders that identify as gender-less to be Politically correct). I'm a 41 year old man, and enjoy the fresh out of the shower scent, and it's quite long lasting. I highly recommend this for both men and women.",4

2469,I like using the Brut Black cologne for everyday use and after night time shower . It smells fresh and middle level intense cologne fragrance scent smell.I wish they had made splash on one as well.,4
2469,I've loved Brut green since it was a Faberge product. The scent is not the same as the original but similar. I really like Brut black. You need to try it and see for yourself!! ,4
2471,"I don't think I've seen this one before but it smells quite good actually. Surprisingly cheap price, although the bottle looks like an expensive one. I even got a few compliments on it which I did not expect to happen as people usually hate being around others with strong scents. Thanks for the reviews folks. ",5

2471,"My mother loves Catalyst. I always get her one bottle as a ""stocking stuffer"" at Christmas time. Now she has one bottle opened and 3 boxes unopened. So now ,I can concentrate on buying more fragrances for me.",5
2471,"Catalyst is definitely on the heavy side. Bought the mini instead of the big bottle and since there is no lotion,I paired it with some Vaseline Intensive care or any other unscented lotion. ",4
2471,"Maybe it's just me but I find this scent is a lot on the heavy side if sprayed too much. I usually spray it on after a shower but it got me a bit dizzy so I aim for my back,tummy,arms and legs. Just right. Catalyst,for me,is more of a cheap alternative to Beautiful and it lasts very long too.",4

2481,"WoW. Absolutely Intoxicating fragrance. Silage is great. Longevity well above average. The price here is the BEST I've seen. What FragranceNet charges for a 3.3 oz. Bottle. I paid 2.5 times that price for a 1.7 oz. at the Big Department store. I love this site. They make smelling expensive. ...inexpensively wonderful. However, shipping and processing is lengthy. But definitely worth the wait. Thanks for all the samples too!",5

2487,"Britney Spears Island Fantasy is much better than I expected and is really quite sexy -- My husband absolutely LOVES this one! It's a very feminine citrus-y scent. The bottle is beautiful, looks like a sea gem. Only downside is that it doesn't last long, but it is so inexpensive you can easily reapply often. Really wish this came in a body wash and lotion! ",3
2487,This is amazing. The only way to describe it is limes at the beach. The citrus scent isnt too strong though. The scent lasted on my wrists even after they were washed. ,3

Take the lotion too if you have that. ",5

2503,"Just received Symetrie Journey. I ordered it because FragranceNet set me an ad card with the scents of their colognes on it. To me, Journey, of the 4 men's scents was the best. Vision was my second choice, and the other two, Harmony & Quest, reminded me of Old Spice. Just tried Journey on an it smells fantastic! You can beat the price either!

Sadly, I wasn't able to get it on the website before it sold out. So I was delighted to see it on here. This fragrance is a good mix of a lot of things. It's sultry, glamorous, soft, and pretty all in one. It lasts ALL day! Definitely doesn't smell like most VS perfumes. It's such a beautiful smell, kinda powdery, and you can wear it anywhere.

2510,"I love it is smells beautiful! I really like it because of the citrus notes mainly which makes it different enough and imo more palatable from the original alien or angel versions.

2510,Alien Eau sublime es muy rico muy parecido a alien los dos son buenísimos son mugler recomendado. ,5

2516,Smells delicious...like caramel flowers mixed with lite musk. So good,5
2516,"Carmen Electra edp is inoffensive and that is better than being offensive. I cannot smell the individual note break downs that are listed for this fragrance, but the dry down is pretty typical of other sweet, fruity florals (like Viva La Juicy). ",3

2525,"i received my first bottle of Destiny in1991 as a gift when I worked in social services.I loved it. Now Destiny is my go to choice. Then I worked in the casino when Poison and Obsession were the mainstays, people complimented me every day, everywhere about my Destiny. Someone even came into play at my games and said they came in just to have their wife smell my perfume. People even asked me the cost and I said it was a boutique fragrance--special, I couldn't bear to tell them how they could buy it on TV and how inexpensive it was. Now I don't care--I say Destiny found me. I didn't find it. Destiny never overwhelms and always pleases.",5
2527,"From the reviews I thought this would be a wonderful fragrance, sorry this is not for me, it has something in it that suffocates me. I have smelled this in other fragrances, wish I knew what it was so I could avoid it.",1
2527,"The package was on time, actually early than what was said. I truly enjoy this scent can't wait to purchase more from this site.",5
2527,"Oscar De LaRenta; Extraordinary is such a pretty, lovely spring floral. This perfüme just oozes with Cherry Blossom & Peony. It's so sweet, "" Flowery Sweet"" not gourmand. It smells like early springtime in a bottle. Like the fresh flowers that blossom in early spring that make me all happy inside and glad to be alive. I just adore this little treasure. I'm on my third bottle. I love the lotion as well. The lotion is so silky & actually works great! It leaves my skin smooth and it's very saturated with the fragrance. It helps increase the Perfüme's Silage and longevity. The shower gel is fragrant also. I even use a little bit of the shower gel when I shampoo my hair. Then the lotion, then the perfüme. I'm good all day. Others can still smell the fragrance even after work into the evening.",4
2527,"First time purchasing this fragrance and very happy. Not too strong but not mild. Lasts a good part of the day. Very nice fragrance, flowery but not strong and overwhelming or too sweet. I would purchase again and highly recommend. ",5
2528,"This is another Fall/Autumn fragrance that I gravitate toward during the transition of the hot to windy rainy seasons. Its cherry - creamy vanilla - tuberose with a dry down a little woodsy. It is gourmand but not sweet, a little light floral with a hint of rose and a bit woody. Strong projection but longevity is average 6 to 7 hours. Its also nice to spray on scarf a little bit, to give a nice sillage. I will be wearing this in the month of October a lot. ",5
2528,Fendi L'Acquarossa - Sweet but very nice ....,5
2528,very nice scent !!! was a blind buy and i love it !,5

2529,"5th Avenue by Elizabeth Arden is a nice, gentle scent that is not overpowering. It is my signature scent that I have been wearing for years. So glad to find it online as it is not common to locate anymore. To find it at a discount is even better! To stretch the product and also to get a better lather, I mix the hydrating cream cleanser with milk & honey soap on a washcloth for my shower. It leaves a nice subtle scent on my skin that I really like.",5
2531,Fujiyama Gentleman is a nice priced very great smelling fragrance. I always get compliments when I wear this.,5
2531,Jean Paul Gaultier meets Versace the Dreamer. Very nice scent for the price. You can't go wrong with this one. ,4

2548," I love this pretty scent from Pitbull. I don't think I've come across anything like it before,it's a very unique aroma that I believe every girl or woman can wear freely. Few people commented that it smells lovely and even those who aren't fond of perfume actually like it. Will most definitely buy this one again.",5
2548,"Ay ay ay,que lindoooo!!! Pitbull woman smells terrific and I could see why the guy is ever so popular. I love his music,his latino charm but most of all,I loooove this scent. I hope he keeps this one coming. Kudos to Mr. Worldwide for a wonderful product!! ",5
2549,"Prada Candy Sugar Pop is delicious! A playful, feminine, happy and curious scent. It raises up a very pleasant feeling for me. The downside to it is that it only last from one to two hours the max, and that is in cold weather. I’m sad that Prada did not think more about its performance. I believe that this perfume is way too expensive for that reason. I’ve used other known brand name perfumes that are lower in price and the scent last a lot longer. But if you don’t care about the money, you will definitely enjoy this perfume.",3
2550,"Prince 3121, love it !! Hope you will always have it. A bigger bottle would be great too. It smells lovely!",5
2550,"Prince 3121, What can I say? I've been wearing this fragrance since 2007! My husband bought it for me and I've been hooked forever. I'm a lifetime believer in the Man and the Fragrance. I buy two bottles at a time. Never want to be without it!! I wear it and know I am the sexiest woman in the world! I can't find it anywhere else. Thank you so much for being here for me. ",5
2550,"Prince 3121 is a fabulous fragrance! Sexy , mature and woodsy. It last all day and subtle enough to wear all day or at night for date night. It is a fragrance that is unique and like no other on market today. Will order again ",5

2552,"Dude, I’m a dude and I LOVE this scent. I don’t think this is just for women. Datura Noir smells like sunny days on the beach with a soft slightly powdery opening. The powdery note fades quick and I’m left with creamy coconut and spicy tuberose. This stuff is perfect when I’m feeling blue.",5
2552,"I was pleasantly surprised upon receiving Datura Noir. It was a blind buy, and I was expecting something with flowers but didn't expect them to be this beautiful.. It is the scent that is close to jasmine in my opinion. Sometimes you'd walk in the park and then smell this overwhelmingly beautiful scent of honey, sweet, unbearably beautiful. This is what Datura Noir smells like to me. You don't need to spray much of it, 1-2 spray is perfect. If you spray more it may be a bit indole imho.. ",5
2552,"Serge Lutens Datura Noir - is a moderate, feminine fragrance, great balance, a good scent for a professional woman. Not too sweet or too strong. Pleasant but not overwhelming.",3
2553,Absolutely love it smells wonderful!!!,5
2553,Simply Pink was a very good price. Thank you. ,5
2553,Simply pink is sweet fragrance but I prefer Pink sugar .,3
2553,"Simply pink is simply sweet, subtle...I love it!",4
2553,"When I first bought this fragrance I thought it was going to be very similar to the original Pink Sugar. However the dry down on this scent becomes much more like pipe tobacco that very smoky, sweet very intensely vanilla almost passed the baked goods smell more like a man's pipe tobacco that you smell in the air on a hot day. This scent lingers even as you pass by you will definitely get compliments but I would prefer this sent as a evening perfume. Definitely not office appropriate. This definitely could be an wonderful sent for fall and winter.",4
2554,"If you like Declaration by Cartier, you're going to love S.T. Dupont! They smell very similar and they both last long. Try it, you'll LOVE IT!",5
2555,"Stella Mccartney Pop is great everyday scent. Not the most sophisticated but it is definitely not juvenile either, it truly smells yummy!",4
2556,"Great dark & sensual scent! Beast mode & can be unisex. I have Tabacco Oud & This intense version, both are great! Intense is stronger due to Amber/castoruim. ",5

Something, soft, fresh and new for me too!",5

2564,I ordered Woods of Windsor white jasmine I love it its soft powder it Blends into your skin smoothly I couldn't ask for more.,5
2564,"Woods of Windsor White Jasmine dusting powder - I love it!!! I won’t be able to get it often because it’s a bit pricey. I use what I have for special occasions, it makes me happy.",5
2564,"Woods Of Windsor White Jasmine dusting powder BY Woods Of Windsor smells like heaven! It also holds this subtle smell most of the day. The box, puff and price makes this a perfect Christmas present for any woman on my shopping list. I'll be back to this site for other items now I'm sure!",5

2571,Best Armani Fragrance Ever! ,5
2571,"Woodsy fragrance, nice but remain a staunch Armani New lover.",3
2571,"This is definitely a great smelling scent. Giorgio Armani really got this one right just like all the others in his Armani fragrance wardrobe. The blend of tabacco and flowery notes with the cedar. Even though he doesn't mention tabacco as one of the notes u can definitely smell it. I also smell a blend of honey. Excellent frangrance as Armani went out of his comfort zone, but in a very good way. The spices and vanilla blend perfectly.",3
2572,"Banana Republic Alabaster : Love the fresh crisp scent that Alabaster provides. First time I purchased this scent was back in 2010 and absolutely feel in love with the clean, simple and fresh smell. Very light for daily wear and for the office. Highly recommend it! ",5

2598,"An excellent oriental wood fragrance! This house is definitely something to watch. I cannot believe the price on this one. Doesn't smell synthetic either. This is beast-mode, and you don’t need more than four sprays. I wouldn't recommend for the office. Definitely an oriental wood for the club, a night at the pub, evening event, fall and winter fragrance. I’m not sure why this house doesn’t get more attention. Really smells fantastic!",5
2600,"Gucci Flora Gracious Tuberose: sample size bottle. I like it. It is a light, watery floral--not heavy like Tuberose actually smells--and is fine to wear around people who don't like strong fragrances. My boss has allergies, but he doesn't complain about this fragrance. The fragrance lasts all day, but it is very, very subtle, and I put a lot on when I first apply it on pulse points all over my body, especially between my thighs and behind my knees that stay warm because of my clothing all day. As I move about, I get whiffs of the fragrance, and that's how I know it lasts all day. ",5
2600,"I love this floral fragrance, it is very fresh and lasts a long time. It is my favorite fragrance to use it all day long.",5

I'm usually not one to wear perfume in general,because I have sensitive skin but this one is light,and long lasting on me and I'm thinking of getting the perfume to match.

2607,"Je Reviens is a soft fragrance. Worth the buy , because it last all day. ",5
2607,Using Je Reviens by Worth brings back memories of Paris in the springtime. The scent is different from other overbearing fragrances and I feel special when I wear it. Just delightful!,5
2607,Je Reviens body spray is just as pure an example of the lovely scent as a small vial of the perfume and it's easier to use. Pure floral pleasure with iris and ambergis to add to the scent layers. ,4
2610,Kenneth Cole Reaction Body mist is a light scent that last throughout the day to the evening. Love the floral scent.,5
2610,Smell too good!! I'm ordering the purfume,5
2610,Very good for a body spray,4
2611,L’Heure Bleue I love the scent. Buy the tester to carry in purse because the scent fades fast. Does not have lasting scent. Great when first sprayed. ,3
2611,"Guerlain's L'Heure Bleue has been around for a very long time for a good reason -- it's a classic. For me, it's a classic day time scent. Light, vaguely floral - vaguely oriental. It's perfect for the office, as most perfumes are too obvious / too inappropriate for business women (if they want to be taken seriously). The eau de toilette spray makes is so easy in the morning -- just spritz it on, last thing before I leave the house. If I am going out to dinner, I might then apply the eau de parfum -- as it is more concentrated but as it is the same scent, it doesn't conflict with the remnants of my morning scent.",5
2611,"L'Heure Bleue. This fragrance is classic and old fashioned but at the same time girly and careless. Even mischievous. Could be good, but somehow it does not come together and something is missing. EDT does not last long. May be couple of Hours at most. It was reformulated some years ago and not an original formula. Feels like it's synthetic. Try to test it somewhere before you buy to be sure that you like it.",2
2611,"L'Heure Bleue is a lovely fragrance. I don't have a signature perfume. However this is a perfume that I can and do wear anytime I please. It is oriental but not overly so. What I love about it is that not that many women use it or even know about it. So when you walk into a room whether it be business, friends, or strangers .....you do not leave a delicate waft of what everyone else is wearing. You leave a waft of something almost magical. I am an unabashed lover of Guerlain's fragrances as well as many other old fragrances. I said that this is for mature women but a woman can certainly be mature at 25yrs......it depends on the woman. ",3
2611, L'Heure Bleu is a sure winner. It's been around for a loooooong time for a reason. Pure class.,5
2612,"L’oriental white is a sleeper, tried it at a mall shop and is awesome for the price, ",5
2612,"I just got my ""L'Oriental white edition"" first time I got it. It smells so good. Love it..",5
2613,"La Mia Parka by La Perks is soft, sexy, warm, not too sweet, ultra feminine scent with just a powdery hint. Like being wrapped in cashmere. Perfect for a summer night. It's my daily fragrance. ",5
2614,"This is an amazing masculine fragrance. Lalique hit's this out of the park. It opens with bergamont and spice, and then after 10 minutes dries down into a nice wood and earthy scent given that the patchouli stands this up. This is a nice rounded patchouli and not sharp. A warm and spicy fragrance that could be warn spring or fall. I'm not sure about wearing this one to the office. This fragrance was a blind-buy for me and I'm really enjoying it. Two thumbs up from me!",4
2614,"Lalique Homme Voyageur: amazing, unique, deep, intriguing scent. I love this fragrance. Versatile and awesome! ",5
2614,I love it I have it in my top 5,5
2619,"Molinard de Molinard is a very old, timeless, classic fragrance that I first complimented my Aunt Barbara on. Then my mother had some too. It’s a beautiful fragrance that is very old, French? and I’m thrilled to get it back in stock at such a reasonable price. I hope they never run out. It has such a distinct amazing smell that I’ve gotten stopped many times with compliments and requests for telling them what it was when they couldn’t guess the name. I adore it! ",5
2619,"I ordered Molinard De Molinard on a lark. And me being me, I ordered two even though I had no idea of what the fragrance was like. I am now ordering a couple more.....running out is just not an option. Floral and slightly fruity with additional additives that I cannot recognize. But it's clean, light but 'nose catching' and just absolutely captivating. It doesn't last that long, but since it is not expensive I will carry one in my handbag for a sly spritz. I love the bottle as well. It looks like Baccarat could have made it two hundred years ago. Very rich in appearance and then on top of that...…..the fragrance which I believe may just have been made with the tears of Angels. ",5
2619,It has been many years since I used this fragrance and I’m happy to say I still love it! I don’t see any Molinard de Molinard lotion thou,5
2619,"Moulinard de Moulinard is my favorite fragrance. It is a fruity fresh floral and very feminine without being over powering or candy smelling which seems typical for the new fragrances introduced today. It is classic, pleasant and seems to last long enough to enjoy throughout the day even as a toilette. I feel it is a best kept secret in the fragrance category and I wish they would bring back the body powder and lotion which was available years back. It is not a fragrance that would be common so I appreciate the uniqueness of this fresh scent for day or evening wear. ",5

2623,"Only Me Passion perfume is absolutely lovely. The scent draws attention. Written by Mae May 20, 2019",5
2623,I got this “Only Me Passion” perfume as a gift and I absolutely love it. ,5
2623,I love this fragrance because it's light but it carries its on scent. You don't have to put on much it has a scent that draws attention in a good way. ,5
2625,I just received my Oscar de la Renta Rose. I am loving it. The scent is so feminine. It's a floral mix and it melds very nicely to make the scent heady. ,5
2625,"i love this perfume, very fast shipping ",5
2625,"Oscar de Larenta Rose is new for me. So glad I found it. It's a very romantic scent. Soft Roses, just love it.",5
2626,"Parfums de marly sedbury This perfume is DEVINE. Sedbury smells so rich and luxurious, i cant stop smellimg myself, it gets better as the day goes by, i would get a wiff of sedbury and am like omg, who smell so amazing, then i realized its me, and compliments like none other. No one will smell like you. Blind buy worth. ",5
2626,"PARFUM DE MARLY SEDBURY - excellent price on Fragrance Net but still an investment for a blind buy. Pretty floral with a sharp amber note to start but which settles down quickly to a floral skin scent. I put on Lancome Climat EDT(new version) on one arm and Sedbury EDP on the other at the same time and the Climat lingers longer. I'm always amazed when a reformulated EDT outlasts a niche and highly concentrated EDP. Do I like it? Yes. Would I buy again? Probably not due to the performance (at least on me, it may perform better on someone else).",4
2627,"I love Iris Prima and I hope I will always be able to have it! I have the edp and the hand and body cream. There is a15 to 20 minute dry-down before the true scent comes through, but it is worth the wait. I find it soft, powdery and very dreamy. Not overpowering on me and someone needs to be close to smell it. I definitely recommend this fragrance and will by it again!",5
2628,Perfume muy bueno unos de mis preferido dura todo el día aunq tu no te lo sientas las otras personas si tiene buen fiador y es como aceitoso q hace q dure mas me encanta ,5

2631,Smells excellent but I can’t find it anywhere to purchase.,4
2631,Polo Supreme Oud is my intro to our fragrances and I'm sold!!!! It smells wonderfully woody and spicy at the same time! I'm thinking it is so different that it's a good signature fragrance for me.... thanks for making it available on fragranceNet!,5
2631,"My new Ralph Lauren favorite. Rich, warm, woodsy. I have both and I get more “leather” from this than the Supreme Leather, but maybe that’s just me (though I worked in a leather store, so I’m pretty familiar with that particular scent). I disagree that it’s a old guy’s fragrance, but I guess that’s all in perspective too. If I bought into all this “what time of day, what season, what situation” a scent should be worn, I might say it was appropriate evening, cool weather, social situation wear. But I believe that you should wear what you love whenever you want and tailor the amount you use to the situation. This one’s definitely worth a try and one you want to use a light hand with.",5
2631,Great price and the Polo Supreme smells very good,5
2631,"Polo Supreme Oud. Based on a sample, I really like it. Woody and spicy, but also soft and powdery, maybe a little mossy. Funny, I don't get the cinnamon that DM7 mentions at all. And I don't get ""rugged"" at all. That's body chemistry, I guess. It just seems to get ""softer"" as it develops on me.",4
2632,Fresh by Ralph Lauren is one of my favorite fragrances of all the time everybody compliment it when I wear it,5
2632,I put it on even when im alone. I love the clean smell,5
2632,Ralph Lauren fresh is so clean fresh smelling I jut love it,5
2632,"Ralph Lauren "" Fresh"" is a delightful fragrance. It could be worn any time of the day. It is a spring/summer fragrance. I have worn it many times, and received endless compliments by male and females. This fragrance could be worn for a "" black tie affair"" or Sat morning walk in the woods. Try it, I know you will like it.",5
2633,"Reve-Van Cleef & Arpels Goes on very pretty, light floral but turns sweet and stale. Dries down powdery and feminine. ",3
2633,Reve Van Cleef does NOT LAST AT ALL. Save your money and buy something like any Kenzo.,1
2633,This fragrance does NOT last. Not at all. Very disappointed.,1

2634,EMPRESS BY SEAN JOHN I HAVE ENJOYED THE FACT THAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO ADD CONFIDENCE TO WOMEN AND WAS MADE FOR POWERFUL WOMEN....THAT'S A REFRESHING IDEA. I LIKE THE GENTLE FRUITY TONES AT THE START....IT SETTLES INTO A WARMER BASE NOTE,5
2635,"Serge Lutens Gingembre was a blind buy, and I’m thrilled. I was testing several frags and kept coming back to it wondering what smelled so good! It’s a sweet, spicy ginger that replaces the citrus in a traditional men’s cologne structure. When the opening sweetenes fades it’s left warm and inviting. 9/10",5
2636,"Love it! Such a light fresh scent, great for spring and summer. ",5
2636,Sunflowers Summer Bloom smells just like Chanel Chance eu de Tendre. Only difference is it literally lasts 2 minutes then it smells like you never sprayed any perfume on at all. Great for anyone who doesn't like perfume. I would not buy this perfume again. I'd rather spend $100 dollars more on my Chanel.,1
2636,I am so delighted with my purchase of this Sunflowers perfume. Summer bloom is fresh and captures the essence of a warm sunny day driving by the countryside taking in some scenery & that soft breeze just blowing all around you. Not heavy or overpowering like the original which I never liked. Anybody can wear this one and the price is just right. Try summer bloom today.,5
2636,Sunflowers Summer blooms !! Is very good perfume do you like Chanel Chance Eau Tendré is the same !!,5
2636,Sunflowers Dream Petals!! Is very good perfume do you like Chanel Chance Eau Tendré is the same !!,5

2637,I am very pleased with my purchase of Symetrie Inspire cologne for men and I received many compliments!!!!,5
2637,( Symetrie Inspire) This is perhaps the cleanest and freshest smelling men's fragrance I own-but it fades quickly. Pity! I use it when I will not be out very long..,3
2637,"I just purchased Symetrie Inspire and I really like the scent; however,it fades very quickly, It has a fresh clean scent which I would gladly purchase again but only if it had more staying power . Pity! Carl",2

I bought this as a blind buy because I LOVE the smell of vanilla and roses and I am so glad that I got this. this will definitely be my new signature scent and I'm just so pleased with this scent. go out and buy it!!!! you will NOT be disappointed ",5
2639,"I just received this today. Ordered it here with my discount code. This is so worth every penny. Always love Lancome fragrances, they are just beautiful. This is a sweet narcotic fragrance. Such a beautiful vanilla floral on me. I want to the original Tresor de nuit. Sillage is pretty good and longevity excellent I sprayed it last night and this morning I can still smell it. Every note in here mixes well together. Highly recommended. Fragrancenet exceptional packages always arrive well secured and love the samples.",5
2639,I love Lancome's La Nuit Line! A La Folie is just as wonderful with a deep vanilla scent and spicy berry rose. Beautiful. Thank you Fragrancenet for carrying this gem and at a great price because its a tester. Service was awesome as usual. ,5

2648,"I've used the Bal à Versailles parfum for well over 30 years. And yes, I always received compliments on the way it smelled on me. It went extremely well with my body chemistry. It was discontinued for a few years, which led me on hunting expeditions to find it. Unfortunately, I had to eventually settle for other fragrances, none of which produced the scent that I was accustomed to. I am elated that it is back, even though I am a little disappointed that the parfum is not quite the same. It appears to be a little watered down, but it is still my favorite fragrance.",5
2648,"Received Bal a Versailles about a week or two ago. I bought it specifically because I am a Michael Jackson fan and every book I have read about him references this scent. At first, I made the mistake of buying the Eau De Toilette, which smelled like an old lady. It wasn't until I found a website where Karen Faye said to buy the PERFUME instead of the Eau De Toilette as they smell different from one another. It took a bit of getting used to. I've read that the perfume smelled like powder on Michael and on Karen Faye it smelled earthy. I can smell all of it. My brothers said it smelled like powder on me, which is actually the scent I was hoping for lol. It smells nice. I bought the cheapest one which is the small bottle. I literally just rub a little bit of it on my fingers and it lasts the entire day. I love it and I recommend it for any MJ fan or Elizabeth Taylor fan, as it was Elizabeth that got Michael hooked onto the stuff, to begin with!",5
2648,I have been wearing this perfume for fifty-five years. It is me trade mark and I get nothing but compliments from both men and women. To Krissy 9ozs doesn’t keep me happy for long because I take a bath in it-lol.,5
2648,I’ve been using Bal a Versailles for over 45 years and would never use anything else! This is the best price I’ve ever seen for it And so many people have commented about the scent. Amazing !,5
2648,I have been addicted to this scent since 1975. My then boss' girlfriend used it and I started using it. Nothing like it. Too bad it's so hard to find and the body lotion is almost impossible. ,5
2650,This little gem smells amazing. It has a hint of orange and high-class spiciness and reminds me of my favorite Hermes perfume. Was pleasantly surprised by Bill Blass 7 ,5
2651,Black soul is the best ted lapidus product for me it smells fantastic and will draw alot of compliments. You can't go wrong with this one. I love wearing it and the ladies at work love smelling it on me.,5

2659,Love the Bvlgari shower oil. ,5
2660,Good price and good body cream,5
2662,Long lasting fragrance pretty strong one spay needed. Too expensive for size of bottle though (Channel Coco),4
2662,"This was once the most beautiful perfume ever created, a literal masterpiece . As of today in 2019, my beloved COCO is on life support and only the bottle is still the same. I hope to see COCO returned to her former glory , the queen of orientals. If that occurs, I will eagerly purchase again. ",1
2665,I like it a lot! I checked the product code on it with a product verification website and it is definitely legit Creed. Great savings and a great product. Erolfa is a unique and marine/fresh fragrance that a scent lover will adore. ,5
2665,"Tried Erolfa at NM creed stall, it's moderately strong and lingers on for good 6 hours and up. It's dry down is pretty much similar to Creed Imperial Millesima, very rich as if you belong to a royal family. Its not for office or casual use but more for special functions or even date nights. Worth every penny.",5
2665,I've never ordered a Creed fragrance from this site. I've ordered many designers. i was sceptical about the authenticity of this at first. But it's the real deal. Beautiful scent. This is one of my signature scents. A definite compliment getter. Thank you Fragrancenet. I will be back.,5
2666,CURVE Skin Soother leaves skin feeling smooth and smells great,5

2667,"D & C's Light Blue women's spray: This is the best women's scent on the planet! Every time I wear it, I feel so good about myself; it makes me feel confident and assured that I am able to present myself in a very positive way. I receive constant compliments from both men and women, young and older! In fact, my niece wears it. Now it is both of our trademark! When she runs out of it, she stops by my house and borrows it!

2671,"Very fresh smelling,not overwhelming like an Axe body spray...complements well with Drakkar Noir cologne!",5
2671,"Being a huge fan of Guy LaRouche Drakkar Noir,I thought I'd give Drakkar Essence deodorant body spray a try...good choice! Much different,but just as high quality! Very fresh smelling...not overpowering,but does the job...I highly recommend Drakkar Essence deodorant body spray! Mark M.Woitach",5
2673,Beautiful smell beautiful price,5
2674,Esencia De Loewe by Loewe Excellent!,5
2674,Esencia by Loewe is the only cologne that I will wear. It has an incredible scent and both men and women always inquire as to what I am wearing. There is not a day that I am not wearing this wonderful cologne. It is appropriate for all type of occasions.,5
2674,"Esencia De Loewe, Very masculine and sexy, its the scent my boyfriend prefers on me, the smell is like nothing else, this fragrance had all good things in it self, its one of my all time favorites all over the years, Super sexy!!!",5
2675,Frozen Disney huele muy rico buena opción para las niñas,5

2676,Nice one! the women & men like it they ask me what cologne u wear.....??!! Perfect for 5 hours (sexy).,4
2677,"Wonderful, masculine aroma. I wear it modestly, and women turn their heads, as I pass by. Others I sense are ""Aroused"", as I sense their pheromones, more so the longer we are near. One mentioned feeling ""Intoxicated"". Not bragging. Just the opposite. ",5
2677,Great Price! I’ve been looking for this for awhile now. Great scent for special occasions when you don’t wanna sell like everyone else.,5
2677,L'homme Ideal EDP by Guerlain. I love this fragrance. It's warm and comforting. Smells really good. Everyone loves it except my wife sadly. But to her nothing smells good except ysl l'homme line or Valentino uomo. Formal fragrance. Average longevity. 8/10 overall.,4
2677,Thanks fragrancenet! I couldn't find this fragrance at any other reliable site. Awesome fragrance! I've been dealing with this site since high school and I'm 30 now. I'm not going anywhere. Keep it up!,5
2677,"This is wicked stuff. Bold, sophisticated, masculine and unique. I LOVE IT!!! Too bad fragrancenet doesn't have but samples. I had to get it elsewhere. ",5
2680,I love Taylor swift incredible things its incredible its like a soft but fresh citrus with like a flowery smell its amazing Its one of my favourites.,5
2680,I love this perfume I buy it all the time its one of Taylor swift best ones for me you won't be disappointed with this smell its like A garden full of fresh beautiful flowers! Incredible things,5
2680,Magnificent scent. I promise it won't disappoint you. The aroma it's like being in a beautiful garden of soft flowers. Thank's Taylor Swift. (Incredible Things),5
2680,This one does have a spice to it. Its also a fresh outdoor scent. Has a citrus smell and flows smell to it. Its overall really good. I bought this without knowing how it smells. Its very vanilla smelling. Vanilla is my favorite! Overall its really good. ,5
2680,"I ran across this perfume at Kohls and had to have it but have since run out so I'm glad I found it on Fnet for a lot cheaper. This perfume usually attracts younger ladies but I am in my mid 30's and had to have it. The main obvious notes are vanilla, musk, and some type of florals. It reminds me of something you would want to wear on a rainy day because it's both sweet and fresh!",4
2681,"Jadore has been out since 2000! It was the fragrance I had been looking for as I had grown tired of my previous favorites. After finding a sample in a magazine, I knew this was the one to purchase next. It's still my favorite although I enjoy trying others from time to time.",5
2681,I absolutely love Jadore cologne and wood recommend to anyone who wants a cologne that is subtly soft never over powering like some even if you add a little too much. The fragrance lasts the whole day and with a little additional spritz it will go on into the night. ,5
2681,There is just nothing I enjoy wearing as much as Jadore. I always get compliments about the scent.,5
2683,Jaguar Vision is absolutely amazing. The ladies love smelling it on me and I get a lot of compliments and questions from guys asking what I’m wearing. Definitely buying again ,5
2683,Vision smells quite similar to Gold also by Jaguar yet it smells less strong and more fresh with citrus. I immediately fell in love with Vision on the first sniff! I've only tried these two fragrances from Jaguar and so far Vision is my favorite. Any guy who loves fresh citric scents would love this one! Longevity would be a 7 out of 10,4
2685," I have received a lot of compliments on this Kouros fragrance. I truly like it no matter where I go, or how much I put on it, I have received a lot of compliments.I would recommend this product to other men who love to smell good. Thank you Lucius ",5
2687,"This one is notably more sweet than Lapidus pour Homme. It starts off with a rich honey tonka bean slightly woodsiness, that dries-down to what I would describe as a syrupy-cola smell with a little bit of woodsy lavender. Kind of like the soft drink syrup before is gets mixed with the carbonated water to make the cola with an hint of incense. This fragrance has incredible longevity (8-10 hrs easy) and a heavy sillage. It's a sensational scent, and probably best geared toward those over 30, but could be a clubbing scent due to its sweetness and powerhouse quality. This was a blind-buy for me based on ratings, and I absolutely love it. I'd still rate Aramis much higher, but this is an excellent value for a classic cologne. ",5
2687,I have used lapidus for over 25 years i will go anywhere to get tis products it really is the very best.,5
2689,Love of pink is pretty. I prefer this one over touch of pink any time. Goes with all my casual outfits while I use Lacoste pour femme for nights out. ,5
2689,Love of pink from Lacoste is great in sense and just the perfect perfume.,5
2689,Great all around. Thanks,5
2689,"LACOSTE LOVE OF PINK is amazing I feel in love with it immediately. It a unique smell fresh, floral and citrus. You can wear it any wear just don't overdue it cause a little goes a long way. ",5
2692,"Pink bouquet is my favorite fragrance righht now. It's like a fresh, light, clean and fruity fragrance.",5
2692,"Moschino pink bouquet is citrus with under tones of a floral scent that keeps it on check. It is great for everyday and for any age. You can't go wrong with this one. Better get a travel size to go with you. Doesn't last more than a few hours But, totally worth it! ",5
2692,"Got this fragrance to try, since I love all the Moschino products (funny is my fav) and LOVE it. I seem to love all the different variations that Moschino makes. This one is a bit more flowery with citrus undertones. I really do like/love all the perfumes! You can't go wrong to try them. None of them are overwhelming.",5
2692,"Love the fragrance, Pink Bouquet!! All the Moschino fragrances are awesome!!",5
2693,"Neroli is a clean and fresh Parfume used in the evening, in my opinion. Perfect! Maria Rennard",5
2694,I had a sample of Mervin bourbon. Love love love it! I ordered the set so I can try the rest. Can't wait... very sexy smell.,5
2695,"I love Oscar De Le Renta products !! I love the deodorant and bath powder . I love Nude because of the fregrance and I get so many compliments, I give it to my friends also nurses at the cancer center who always tell me how good I smell. ",5
2696,I came across this fragrance at Burlington's. And the scents last all day received a lot of compliments from my friend's and co-worker. ,5
2699,LOVE IT...HAVE BEEN WEARING IT FOR YEARS... ,5
2702,Roberto Cavalli Noire. This is a tricky fragrance. I don't think it would be for everyone. The initial opening isn't that good but the dry down is amazing. It's a very classic sophisticated sent with a hint of sweetness. I could definitely picture a professional woman wearing this. The projection was good but the performance was amazing it was still smelling the next day.,5
2702,I was introduced to Roberto Cavali Nero Assoluto by a friend who is an international flight attendant who purchased it for me in Italy before it was available in the US. After wearing it I was hooked because of the constant compliments from both sexes but more so from my personal love of the fragrance. Many people may think that this should only be worn in the evening but I don't think that it's too heavy to wear all day. It's an extremely sexy fragrance!,5
2702,"I purchased this fragrance on a whim and glad I did. The 1st spraying smells very woodsy. As it settles on your skin, you then sense the exotic floral and vanilla tones. Its not a fruity soft smell at all...very sensual. You'll enjoy this on a romantic date. My only negative is that its not long-lasting.",5
2702,"I ordered this for the first time without sampling. I'm extremely pleased with Nero Assoluto. The initial spraying is very intense and woodsy. But as fragrance sinks into your skin, it starts to soften up. That's when you start smelling the vanilla and fruity combination. I'd wear this scent on a date or romantic evening out with your significant other. Its very sensuous! My only complaint would be that the scent is not long lasting...hence the 4 stars. Still, its a wonderful fragrance and addition to my Cavalli collection.",4
2702,"Roberto Cavalli Nero Abssolute - What a departure from the standard Cavalli scents. This is more akin to Black Orchid by Tom Ford. Definitely not your mothers scent choice. Mysterious, not a sweetie. This is a ""go get em Tiger"", kind of scent.",4
2703,"I've been wearing Serpentine for over 10 years now and still love it. Its my favorite everyday fragrance and its light, versatile and suitable for every season of the year. People compliment me all the time and ask where they could buy it. I always direct them to FragranceNet...where else? My only lament is that fragrance does not last long on my skin.",4
2703,This is a soft perfume. I love it.,5
2703,Serpentine- found it in a sample-been wearing it ever since. Even people who claim to be allergic love it!!!! I wear nothing else!,5
2703,Serpentine is my to go favorite. Have gotten many compliments.,5
2703,My husband loved the smell of serpentine on me.,5
2704,Symetrie embrace is my favorite so far...it undertones are a subtle scent but very enveloping,5
2704,I love Symetrie's Embrace. Although it sometimes appears that the scent has left you it is actually still there but becomes one of those scents that becomes a part of you. Others notice it's subtlety hours after applying it.,5
2704,I received a sample of the embrace and loved it but after 15-20 minutes the scent was gone. I hate that. I love the scent. I was going to buy it but glad I didn't and a had sample first. Please remake the formula and make it so the scent stays on all day. ,2
2704,The Symetrie Embrace is now my favorite scent! I usually wear the original Michael Kord but I am in love with Embrace! I am hoping they will come out with a lotion as well!,5
2704,"Symetrie’s EMBRACE’ would have been my #1go to forever if, like indicated above, the fragrance had more staying power! It’s delicious but it’s only that good for like 15 minutes if that. Remake the formula, let it have the longevity of Shakinar, Opium, Estée Lauder Youth Dew (you don’t have to like these but for sure they are part of your entire day no matter your climate) and you would have a big time. Ladies new scent winner!! Or make it into a linen spray, I would purchase that and have very pleasant dreams. ",3
2709,"""Flower Princess by Vera Wang"" is a nice scent. It definitely delivers as a subtle flower aroma for the skin. It is not as sweet as one might expect, but layers nice with sweeter fragrance to make a mature sweet scent that gets compliments.",3
2711,Get this for my wife ('Nana's Powder'). She love it.,5
2711,IT HARDLY HAS ANY SCENT to it. It just feels like powder with no scent. : ( Too bad. I won't purchase it again. ,1
2711,Windsor Wood Lavender powder is nice scent. Nice to use during the hot months when we want to smell nice when it is sticky outside.,5
2711,"I am one of those woman that wears talcum powder, that you can dust on with a powder puff, after every shower or bath. I love it. It makes my skin silky and just makes me feel good. I have heard of Woods of Windsor but I have never tried it and when I saw they had a lavender scent I had to have it. I haven't opened it yet but I can smell it through the package and it smells wonderful. Lavender is my favorite scent, I have room sprays, hair products and now powder, I can't wait to use it.",5

2713,"Awesome scent, that I didn't appreciate upon first smelling, once it settle in 5 mins, I was blown away of how fresh, sophisticated and so masculine it was. I bought me 3 sets and one for my dad. Its also a head turner and compliment magnet. Go get it. If you dont like this, your probably a picky fragrance head. I like both designer and niche scents, but picky on designer. This is one of those pickys. I wonder why this can only be found in ferragamo stores as far as retail goes. This way better than the heavily praised Acqua di gio. This is a classic",5
2713,"This is a a perfect suit and tie fragrance. It's so clean and classy. I was very turned off by how it smelled initially, but the drydown is rather fresh and soapy. It's sillage and longevity is fair. ",3

2725,"Excellent product, I love it lasts all day long.",5
2725,This has become my signature fragrance. I get compliments on it every time I wear it. It is long lasting (and in some ways grows more alluring as the day goes on) and a little goes a long way if you spray all the pulse points and warm spots. Very womanly scent!,5
2727,"I really like the Clean Skin eau the parfum, so I thought I'd try the Clean Skin body cream to go with it. I was a bit disappointed as I did not find that the cream come close to the smell of the Clean Skin perfume at all. It's not unpleasant, and the cream does feel nice and has a nice texture, but I was really hoping that the smell of the cream would be more similar to the spray perfume. ",3

2735,"I have been using English Leather Black for over 40 years. I have utilized other products but I get the most compliments from using the black cologne. I use the regular for after shave as well. Really sorry to see that they have quit making the black and it would appear they are now doing the same thing with the regular cologne, after shave and splash on. I have so many excellent compliments on the black. Hopefully some other manufacturer has something like it. I have experimented several of the black colognes thinking maybe they would be close but they are no way close to the English Leather. ...Anyone finds anything close please give a shout out. I bought these smaller ones and they are the legit black with the wooden top....sad to see them go.",5

2742,"I love this cologne...it's different, it's subtle and it's not overbearing. It's a signature scent.",5
2743,Dahlia Noir is the best. I get completes every time I wear it. Givenchy makes the most sensual fragrances by far.,5
2743,Dahilia by Givenchy is a beautiful fragrance.❤❤❤❤,5
2744,"When I received the Idylle by Guerlain perfume spray, I was impressed by the very nice sent which is mild for a spray. Other perfume sprays tend to be overwhelmingly strong. I originally purchased the Lotion Perfume when I traveled to France and didn't think I would be able to find it again for a decent price in the US. I'm very pleased!",5
2745,"It's so right in its description of this wonderful Fragrans when It says that it doesn't bother coworkers because it doesn't its unassuming .It is the most beautiful Evocative yet Unassuming fragrant Flower mixed with Spices.

2746,I purchase Intrusion by Oscar de Larenta for my friend for Christmas. (Her favorite perfume is Angel and I am really tired of smelling that one.) Intrusion is light and flowery but not sicky. Gives off a clean fresh scent that will stay with you for hours. She loved the gift and said that this will be one of her favorites. ,5
2747,Jay-Z Gold deodorant has a very nice smell to it. But don't wear it to go out and play sports and think it'll last you for hours. This deodorant in my opinion should be put on for a date night with your last. Even better if you have the Gold cologne to go with the deodorant. ,4

2758,"Prada Candy Scrub, is awesome and amazing!!! I just received my package today and took a shower with my scrub and it is by far the best body scrub that I have personally experienced. I am referring to the texture, which is smooth and velvet like, and is not like rocks for scrub. There are very small crystals and it is like a lotion or body cream texture. It is very delicate and delightful! The scrub smells DELICIOUS! A smooth sweet aroma. This is the very first sweet smell that I have EVER purchased and I love it! I also purchased the Prada Candy parfum to go with it, it is just as lovely. This is coming from someone who totally dislikes sweet smells period! Give it a whirl, what do you have to lose?!",5
2758,"I love my Prada Candy scrub. It has the same consistency as Victoria Secrets petal scrubs. It’s not too oily, but will give your skin a light coat. Smells great and is perfec for layering your fragrance. I wish they made a potion and body butter too.",5
2758,"Prada Candy body scrub is the best body scrub I have ever used! It doesn’t clump up and fall out of your hand when you apply it. The texture is so creamy and thinner so it stays on your skin when you apply it, it smells magnificent, my sisters love it too, Highly recommend this product,",5
2758,Panda candy scub is good wish you would be able to put in plastic I'm affair it will break in the shower.,4

2763,"Holy-cow. Santal Majuscule by Serge Lutens my just be what fragrance dreams are made of. Not overly complicated. A real high quality sandalwood. Creamy, not harsh or overly woody. There is a floral stickiness to this scent but it leans more masculine for sure!!! This has become an overnight staple in my collection. ",5
2763,"If you like the sophisticated concoction of sandalwood and rose, this is the one for your signature scent. ",5
2763,"Santal Majuscule on my skin is almost pure sandalwood, soft and milky. If applied at bedtime I waken with the scent almost undiminished. I love many sandalwood perfumes but this is my favorite. 5 stars ",5

I gets comments “every single day “ I would not recommend to anyone ,5
2766,"I love this Tender Romance so much because it is one of the few fragrances that stays on me. I have very dry skin, so I have been a big fan of Ralph Lauren’s perfumes. I very seldom ever wear any other brand. I highly recommend any of his products. ",5

2780,Boss The Scent Private Accord is a GREAT smelling cologne! Lasts longer on clothing than skin as most colognes do. This also depends on the wearer. I get a good 5-6 hours and I feel that’s ok. Deducting a star ONLY because the performance SHOULD be better. Good juice! ,4

2788,"Courreges Empriente - So nice to find a nice fragrance that doesn't smell like the other 40 scents you saw at the drug store or department store. Individual, complimentary to everyone I have ever noticed wearing it, and the type of scent you will catch yourself ""sniffing"" yourself . That's a good sign.

I am enjoying the scent very much.",5
2798,"Hermes scents are so deep, so well thought out, so well named. I am addicted to and will always have Sur Le Nil, Jardin En Mediterranee, L'Orange Vert and Un Jardin Apres Le Moussoun in my scent arsenal. BUT with that being my admission? I was hugely disappointed in this one. I didn't find it to smell particularly like grapefruit or rose, didn't/doesn't smell particularly like anything and all Hermes scents do tend to wear away fast but this one, unremarkable as it was with me, seemed to fade to nothing within moments. ",2
2799,"I, too, have been wearing Royal Secret since the 70's. I get many compliments and have been purchasing it from Five Star for some time. I like the darker color and Five Star used to sell that but recently started selling the light shade. They stopped selling the lotion and body wash some time back, but I wish they would start producing those products. When I first started purchasing from Five Star they were selling the Germaine Montiel brand but then changed to their line. I still love the fragrance and will continue to purchase from them. Avid lover of Royal Secret. ",5

I just had a medical procedure and during pre-op, the nurses and staff asked who smells so good and my nurse told them I was the one with the wonderful perfume on. Be prepared to tell your admirers the name and designer name of the perfume. Perfect strangers in elevators tell me how good I smell. I can't say enough about LaVie. I am happy I noticed the Julia Roberts commerical which enticed me to try La Vie",5

But this definitely is a keeper and I like it enough to order it again someday on a splurge.",5
2818,"It's a Decent Cologne, It does last for hours. Good For using it at work, Or Chilling at home. Not one that you want to use when going out on a date or romantic night. It's those smells that make you mean Business, or to smell when someone comes home to visit you. ",4
2818,"Penguin Orginal Blend does not compare to Gucci Guilty...dont be fooled, it's an average light scent...",4
2818,"All of the New Penguin Fragrances are incredible. Every single time I put on Penguin Original Blend, people stop and ask me what cologne I am wearing. It's a very fresh scent that can be worn casually on the beach or at a wedding. It's very similar to the way Gucci Guilty Men smells. Personally I think it's even better. If you buy this fragrance you will receive more compliments than ever before. ",5

2822,"I was ecstatic to find out fragrance net had this product as most other websites do not carry this one. And, I have to say, this one is my signature scent! I love the scent! It's so rich, sweet, and creamy. Yet, even though it is a gourmand, it isn't in your face sweet. It has a subtle sweetness that doesn't strike at you, but more in a soft tone. Obsessed! ",5
2822,"when I first sprayed it, it was too strong. However, after time passes when the middle notes just come out, it smells so so so great. It's just sweet and edible. Love Love Love !!!",5
2822,"Surprised at how great this was. Sexy and feminine, and lasts a decent amount of time for me. Plus the pink and black bottle is cute!",5

2824,I ordered the Shalimar hair mist. This product is great. A few spritzes and I am floating on a cloud of fragrance. Softer in scent than my perfume but very long lasting! My hair is still smooth without residue. Very happy!,5

2844,"I brought the AV perfume for Christmas and I got the other two just to try them, and they were great. The thing about it was I brought it for me, but when my mother and aunt smelled them they loved them. And they took a bottle for them selves and it left me with one bottle. I already used that bottle and need more. I am always getting stopped and they ask me what do I have on, and I try to tell them the best I know how. I know this perfume smells very good, because men compliment me all the time. I love it not because of that, but because I know that it smells great.",5

2879,"James Bond Intense Cologne I first bought a small trial tube for $1.75 as sort of a joke because I'm a huge James Bond fan. It turned out that I LOVED the scent. It's very earthy and masculine and once it settles into your skin also feels very natural. I got the 4.2 ounce bottle for a great price, and the bottle itself is really cool. One caveat: the ""intense"" version is indeed very intense, and I think I over-did it the first couple of times I used it. Other than that, I love it, because I now smell like Bond...James Bond.",5
2880,"Jay Z Gold is the only fragrance my husband wears. I love the woodsy smells along with the hint of ginger and grapefruit that makes it a unique fragrance. As long as he likes it, I will buy it! ",5

2886,"M7 Oud Absolu is a good fruity, sweet fragrance which is appealing but not very masculine. I wore it one wrist for a day and Guerlain L’homme Ideal on the other wrist. As they progressed they developed a sameness but the fruit in the M7 did offer some contrast. Both altered as the day progressed but in a good way.",4
2886,M7 Oud Absolu is a fantastic scent! I thought it was going to be an overpowering scent because a few critics were saying that Oud scents could be. I was pleasantly surprised. YSL colognes are top knotch. I give it 2 thumbs up!!,5

2887,"Got this cologne as a gift. Smells nice and projects for a good 4 hours, after that, the scent stays close to you but is present all day. Extremely good for an EDT. To kind of get an idea of what it smells like, if you have ever smelled the gold colored Curve cologne for men then you will find extreme familiarity with this Ecko cologne. You cannot go wrong with this.",4
2888,This fragrance is light and smells nice. But the scent does not last long. I had to spray it on again 4 hours later. I prefer MC ,3

2888,"Perfume is like food... to each their own. Some smell this and all they'll smell is chocolate raspberries, I however, get taken into a different dimension of candy land. I am 26 and I plan on wearing this scent forever. The silage is uhh-maxing and it clings to my body chemistry like we belong together...the lack of alcohol smell, the distinct smell, the original smell amongst other things makes this perfume a dream. I don't like the bottle. It makes it seem like an overpowering scent but it's light.",5
2888,Lolly Pop Bling Be Mine is sweet and powdery. It is delicate and light. I'm layering it with other scents because it's missing something in my opinion. It mixes nice with my Orange Blossom Naked Bee lotion.,3

2894,"Pheromone lotion is lovely. It's fragrant and lasting when applied usually after a shower. I find that it's a different fragrance than Pheromone perfume but I know that it can mingle with it's subtleties. It's creamy but it doesn't last more than five hours. If you're looking for a lotion that would complement Marilyn Miglin's fragrance, this is it.",3
2894,This is the most exciting scent in lotion. It sparkles and lasts keeping its freshness for eternity.,5
2896,The most beautiful fragrance. Many compliments. A must buy.,5

S Eau Florale is a very gentle but soft & feminine fragrance that won't overpower you or anyone near or around you. It can be used for day or night. Even teen girls or young adults can wear it and it's quite allergy friendly too. Well done,Shakira.",5
2899,"Wow,this scent is delicious. Sweet but a bit more fruity and less candy on my skin. It even remains on my clothes long after I wash them. I stayed by a cousin on vacation once and when I got back home,she called and told me how the spare room still smelled like I was still there. Shakira did an excellent job on this one. ",5
2899,"I love this fragrance from Shakira. Guys tell me I smell like I soaked myself in a bubble bath of flowers & candy,and they love that. Well,I think that's a good thing and I wouldn't mind buying this one again.",5
2899,"I smelled this fragrance on a teenage girl at a book store and I knew I had to get it so I mustered up the courage to ask her the name of it and she said ""It's Shakira S,the pink one."" I went to my nearest cosmetics store and bought it right away. Eau florale is a lovely fragrance & I hope they don't discontinue it any time soon. I'll be stocking up on at least four bottles in the event that happens.",5
2899,"Love this perfume. Lasting power is great,even for a romantic night out. ",5

2900,"I got sexual-fresh for my husband, we loved it",5
2900,Great soft fresh smell last only 2-4 hours only. ,5

2900,"Love Michel Germain....Sexual FRESH is the BEST...both my son's love it...COMPLIMENTS BY EVERYONE...Men and Women always remark how great it smells on my son and many of the guys he stayed with wanted to borrow it, steal it or buy it from him! Not for sale! Lol! ",5

I always get compliments on it and it is the same scent as the original Bright Crystal, but a tad more intense (but not overbearing) and longer-lasting. I would suggest (as with any perfume) to go to Sephora and test it and then come here and buy it for a LOT less :)",5

2916,Jennifer Lopez Wild Glow Bottle is beautiful to add to your collection. Smell Is light and lingers. Similar to Sunflowers by Elizabeth Arden. With a hint of sweet. ,3
2917,"When I was a teen I sampled 4711 at a friend's home during a sleepover. At the time I liked it. After some 50 years passed, I was silly enough to think I still would, so I ordered three of the body sprays. I'll keep them for occasional use during summer evenings, but I'm reminded that just because something is billed as unisex doesn't really mean that it IS. My husband wasn't impressed when it was on me, but I might try talking him into trying it for himself... or not. Not a good choice for me.",2
2917,I bought this the first time in Germany and loved it. I am delighted to be able to buy it here. It is refreshing and not sweet and overall pleasant.,5

2920,Aire Loewe has been My Favourite Perfume for many Years. It was wonderful to receive this Beautiful Perfume Back into My Life again. Many Thanks Jan. ,5
2920,"Aire Loewe edt. Discovered the perfume at the Spanish Pavilion, Expo '88 in beautiful Brisbane. Never experienced anything like it before and I'd been a perfume buff since my first pay packet in '66. Wore it every day to work and at play and never tired of it. Lost count of the compliments and enquiries I received about it. Always fresh, invigorating and just plain different. After years of perfume drought (alleviated only by our local Damask perfumery, and flower essences purchased in Aswan) I found it again on your website and it's just wonderful as I remembered. Being edt, need to top up often though.",5
2922,"This new Angel flanker,""Etoile Des Reves"" reminds me of when I first started wearing it twenty years ago. It smells more ""foody"" and less patchouli. I think it smells better than Angel when first sprayed on, without waiting for it to fully morph into its full potential. This is my third bottle I have bought in less than three years. Love it!!",5
2922,"I love Angel. I have been a fan for many years almost the whole Angel collection. This version is very much like the original but less bold. It is delicate and light, it lasts FOREVER and it seems to me it changes notes throughout the day. Everyone says I smell amazing when I wear it, but interestingly nobody recognizes it as being Angel. This fragrance is like all other Angel versions: strong yet feminine, bold and delicate, and full of subtle nuances. ",5
2922,I just recently purchased Angel Etoile Des Reves. I wear Angel all the time and have for many years. I love this version as well. Every time I go somewhere some one stops me to ask what I'm wearing! They tell me that I smell amazing! This is just as awesome as regular Angel! If you are on the fence about purchasing this don't be! ,5
2922,"This perfume, etoile des rêves, stands out to its name : dreamy. It's sweet , wrappes you as and people that comes near you, Everyone says that I smell good when I have this on.",5
2923,I love Apparition shampoo and body wash by Ungaro!! It’s a non overpowering clean smell and it has a longevity to it that’s perfect. Will use this product for life!! ,5
2925,"I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the fragrance was. I have never used Azzaro Now, but have been using other Azzaro fragrance for at least 30 years. I like it a lot and would buy more in the future. I strongly recommend it to any one. The fragrance leaves a lasting impression and I have had many compliments. ",5
2930,I have been wearing Vanilla by Body Fantasies for over 45 years. I LOVE this fragrance and get comments all the time. When I used to visit my Mom in the nursing home the staff said that all the residents wanted me to visit because I smelled so good and that they complained about everyone else because they hated most smells but LOVED MINE! People everywhere tell me I smell delishous!! Please never stop making this fragrance .. mine for life!,5
2930,Great product for the price ,5
2930,I love Vanilla by Body Fantasies. It smells like vanilla baked goods. The only problem I have with it is that the scent doesn't last that long. I wish the company would make it in a perfume too.,5
2932,"Bond 9, B9 , nice I loved ",5
2932,Nice scent and quality in the packaging.,5
2932,Bond no.9 B-9 is my favorite Bond fragrance so far. I also like Bond Signature Scent. They are both very unique and I can’t get enough of them. They last all day if not longer. I smelled about 10 Bond fragrances but sticking with these 2 for now. Bond B-9 is slightly more feminine and delicate than Signature Scent.,5
2932,"I initially ""experienced"" BOND No, 9 B-9 through a sampler and the fragrance lasted for days even on paper! The bouquet emits a musk-like scent which reminds me of incense, and it has become my new ""parfum-du-jour!"" The B-9 fragrance literally lasts ALL DAY long! If the price is a concern, wait for a sizable coupon and purchase the ""tester"" bottle. Since it is a perfume the aroma is a little heavy, but you'll LOVE it! ",5
2932,"Bond No9-B9 is a unique, yet awesome fragrance that makes someone do a head spin and ask about what you're wearing. The fragrance lasts ALL day, and you even enjoy smelling yourself! Very costly, but certainly worth it!",5
2936,"Bvlgari Aqua. What can I say about this scent and the kit that I bought? Awesome! Perfect for travel. Cologne, after shave balm and shampoo/body wash! Just the right size. This is most assuredly a mans man fragrance! The women LOVE it. Enough said.",5
2942,"(CLEAN Cashmere) Have been searching for my new scent as I enter my 60's, and had been sampling the heavier scents. Found this ""Clean"" fragrance when also searching for a fragrance for my 40 year old daughter, working woman, and mother of one. When the 2.1 oz spray bottle arrived, I sneaked a pump for myself, and immediately fell in love with it. My daughter will never see this in her birthday gifts ;-) The first hit is a bit pungent, which may be the ""citrus lime"" (it has a bite to the nose) but it mellows within minutes, and the blend of the woods takes hold. ""Clean"" is right! And soft as a welcome summer breeze. I do not want to have that ""old woman"" smell and this is the trick. Light, not heavy, for me! It is so light that I don't notice it on myself within a half an hour, but know others can enjoy it when I am on the elevator, or hug someone. I do reapply three times daily. NEVER overwhelms! I give it 4 Stars, only because of needing to reapply to keep the scent fresh all day, a cost effective issue. Jan in Texas",5
2942,"I've always been interested with the Clean scents, I finally got a sample of this Clean Cashmere and immediately fell in love with it. It's a refreshing yet subtle smell. I just wish the scent stays a little longer. ",4
2943,"Great little set. The small bottle is definitely authentic, and allows me to re-apply later in the day. This cologne is great, but the performance is moderate. The aftershave is nice, but does not last as long as the actual cologne. In my experience, aftershave usually last about 1 hr, which is totally acceptable as it is aftershave, not cologne. ",5
2944,I have been wearing Cool Water for longer than I can remember. I get a lot of compliments on it and even though I can't smell it any longer women coming up to me and asking the name of my perfume and telling me it smells nice lets me know it's still working. ,5
2944,"The scent of COOL WATER is wonderful! It is crisp, light, and refreshing. That said; it doesn't seem to last very long.",4
2946,Creation is the same fantastic perfume from many yers .so nice .,5
2946,I’m always stopped and asked “What is that scent ?” It smells wonderful on you.,5
2946,"CREATION was not made to be a perfect match for me - seems to be oriental evening scent. Just to heavy to my taste. Other friends of mine found this perfume very alluring and powdery, so I gave it to my friend who liked it. Fancy packaging and bottle design. ",3
2946,Creation by Ted lapidus edt is a perfume my husband & I found in Fiji on our honeymoon over 30 years ago. I still wear this perfume & love it,5
2946,"""Ted Lapidus Creation"" First time I discovered this fragrance was at the duty free shop in Panama's airport, in 1987. Since then, each time I've put it on, it brings back the beautiful tropical memories (and salsa music) of that country. That is why I only wear it in the summer. I hope Ted Lapidus will never discontinue ""Creation"".",5
2947,Bought it for my wife based off the reviews and it was right on the money. It's a unique aroma. When you first put it on it's intense till it settles in. I love how it wears on my wife. She has gotten a lot of compliments on it. She has Santal from Creed as well and they both smell awesome.,5
2947,"Creed Fleurissimo, eau de parfum by Creed - I bought this for my wife. She loves the this scent and I think it smells great. Very classy too.",5
2947,"I have worn this fragrance for many years. I cannot smell fragrance on me but when strangers start sniffing your neck in a grocery store you know it is good. It is my favorite of them all because it stays with you. It never overwhelms others. I love the house of Creed. Of course, if you think about, how many fragrances are you aware of that makes you stop and ask a stranger what they are wearing.........",5
2947,Love it! Been wearing for years and so many people compliment it. Many go in for another sniff. Elegant but I wear all the time.,5
2950,Love this fruity perfume! Great to find it!,5
2950,This perfume is a what a bargain...You get the whole package..sweet Beautiful long lasting... Yeah I love it,5
2950,I was at first a little hesitant to purchase this fragrance I have purchased her original classic fragrance but not the hot pink ...To my surprise it reminds me of Ed Hardy Hearts & Daggers . It is very fruity like almost like a fruit punch skittles type of fruitiness . I really like fruity fragrances like Escada Sunset Heat so this was perfect . I'm thinking about getting another bottle soon . Dissapointed the vanilla is sold out waiting for it to be back in stock . ,5
2951,Wonderful summer scent. Ordered it twice. ,5
2951,"DKNY ANY summer is one of a best fresh fragrance I've ever smelled. Citrusy , zesty , light . I've found what I was looking for many years. Yaaaay! This is my third time order and again so happy with it. Thank u fragrancenet for such a low prices. ",5
2951,"DKNY Summer: This is a great fragrance for anyone. I wore it last week to my job and my co-worker immediately asked about it. I wanted to know if it was too loud and the reply was ""no"" but that it just smelled great. This is the one of the two scents that I can stand to wear and I love it so much that I also ordered DKNY New York!",5
2954,"Beautiful fragrance, balanced, classy. Highly recommend it.",5
2956,This scent is extremely extremely close to Tom Ford black orchid. I’ve been wearing that for years and I tried this and I can’t spot a difference. ,5
2956,"hello !!! You know when you buy something in the dark without knowing why I ordered only 2 and sold one to my customer and then I was annoyed because I did not buy more, even for my use !!! The fragrance fixes very well and the projection is very good hours on my skin ... Ami ",5
2956,"hello !!! I would like to know when we will have this marvelous perfume I need a 5, very good excellent fixing ... Ami Pedro",5
2958,"Guess 1981 Indigo has a special quality that I have not had in any other fragrance. It is the nice smells that come from a laundry. The cotton, the detergent, the fabric softener, the starch and the spray for ironing. I therefore like it but not all the time. The sameness of many other fragrances is getting boring. This one is unique. It smells clean....not sexy. It is daytime not nighttime.",4
2959," Is a very good cologne , excellent sent, however it doesn’t last that long ",4
2959,"I've been using this cologne since I was 17years old. It's suave, and my wife loves it when I'm wearing it. ",5
2959,Habit Rouge L'eau is one of the best fragrances ever created! Thierry Wasser and Guerlain have created a masterpiece!,5
2959,I'll make this short and sweet. This is one of the best fragrances ever created to me! Thierry Wasser and Guerlain created a masterpiece!,5
2959,"Habit Rouge L'Eau is an absolutely gorgeous, modern take on the original Habit Rouge. I've completely fallen in love with this beautiful fragrance!",5
2961,I found Histoire d'Amour in St. Thomas when I was on a cruise. I have severe allergies and this wonderful perfume does not bother them. I am so happy you carry this as it is part of my daily routine. The fragrance is soft and is perfect for mature ladies as well as young ones. I always smell nice 24-7. I will never run out because I love it and currently have 5 bottles in reserve. ,5
2962,Jaguar Classic Amber....very good fragrance for man,5
2962,"Own Jaguar Amber, Jaguar Gold, and Jaguar (green bottle). Jaguar Amber, very nice woody scent, but was disappointing because of its short staying power.",2
2962,"I recently purchased this and even though the strength is EDT, it's very potent. One spritz is all you need. I used two and as another reviewer mentioned, you can smell it on yourself all day. I do like the scent, though. -Jaguar Classic Amber-",5
2962,Jaguar Classic Amber is a great scent. Masculine yet sweet. Love it !,5
2962,"I purchased several Jaguar scents recently and this was not my favorite. I really enjoyed ""Jaguar-Vision"" but the classic amber came off a bit too strong; you can smell it on yourself all day which would be great if you really enjoyed the scent. ",5
2963,"This fragrance is a conversation ice breaker, style and class advertisement, negotiation tactic and sophisticated chat up line all in one. This is what OTHER people have told me. Don't you dare stop making this!!!",5
2963,"Jazz has been my go to scent since '88 when it came out. It's perfectly subtle...great for day use or evening. It can last for the entire day....there is never a day goes by that I am not complemented on the fragrance. Even my barber liked it when I saw him this week. And, it can smell different on anyone wearing it. Women and men have very positive comments about the fragrance. ",5
2963,"My husband has been wearing Jazz for years, he has tried other fragrances but always says""not as good as jazz,"" and just goes back to his all time favorite! ",5
2963,I got Jazz for my guy and we love it. Very sexy.,5
2963,"My husband has worn Jazz for years. We have been married for 45 years. It is the scent I know is the perfect one for his skin. Not only do I love it but people always comment and ask what he is wearing. It stays on him for hours and permeates his clothes so they smell great too, but the smell doesn't go stale.",5
2966,"I simply love it, was skeptical at first but really its cool and lasts long...",5
2966,This is a new one for me....I love it ,5
2966,"I purchased because I wear the original Joop! cologne and get compliments all the time. This is such a beautiful, subtle and sexy scent for a man. It has hints of warm citrus notes with a vibrancy of woodsy, musk and subdued floral overtones. Very masculine. I'm in love! The 6.7 oz. bottle is the best value and, you will not be disappointed.",5
2966,"Definitely buy this for your collection, you will not be disappointed and neither the person your spending time with, it is an attentions grabber . Go for it you'll see!",5
2966,nice different scent. not sweet or anything. nice subtle ,5
2969,"Kenzo Variety Set, I got this product but I was not satisfied, firstable, because the price is too high for the amount of product (bottles are really small) also The bottle cap is unsafe and opens easily, one of my perfumes came spilled so the bottle was empty. For other hand The customer service was excellent, I contacted with Fragrancenet by chat and they did a refund because that. The quality of the perfumes are ok, but soft My opinion is, manufacturers should make the caps of the bottles more hermetic that support the transportation.",3
2970,The first thing that comes to my mind when I put it on and throughout the day is burning incense. If you are into incense type of smell you will love it ,5
2971,"Skin on Skin is a beautiful orris and saffron suede scent that is unlike anything else I've tried. It opens in a slightly plasticy-synthetic smelling manner but quickly dries down to a heavenly suede scent with a powdery finish. I classified this as floral because alot of the scent focuses on the root of the iris (orris butter) however it is nothing like a typical floral and may be better classified as a light leather. The closest comparison I can make to this is the powdery smell of a Cabbage Patch doll (although it is so much more nuanced and delicious than that. But same family of scent). Sample first, if you can, because, although I love it, it us not for everyone. ",5
2973,It smells good I like it.,4
2974,"Mackie Iridescence is my new favorite fragrance. It is not overpowering and smells so good. I put it on in the morning and you can still smell it at night. It is subtle, yet smells wonderful. I hope you continue to carry this fragrance. I really love it!",5
2974,"BOB MACKIE IS STUNNING. EVERYONE IN THE ROOM, MAKES COMMENT ON HOW GOOD YOU SMELL.I. LOVE IT AND ORDERING MORE.

2974,"Mackie Iridescence is hands down a new favorite! Everything I've ever had from Bob Mackie lasts FOREVER and this is no exception. Put it on in the morning, and it's still going strong at night. It's very sweet, feminine, and sexy. ",5
2974,"Iredescence is my favorite perfume ever. the scent is sensual, subtle, and out of this world!",5
2976,"Marc Jacobs Daisy Kiss Smells wonderful, light scent, not overpowering.",5
2976,I really like the Marc Jacob's Daisy Kiss perfume I ordered. It has a great smell. I like wearing it. People who notice it ask me what it is. I also tell them where I purchased it. Will continue buying it. ,5
2976,"I JUST ""LOVE"" MY MARC JACOBS(DAISY KISS). I RECEIVED IT BEFORE THE SCHEDULED DATE AND I COULDN'T BEEN MORE ""HAPPY & SATISFIED""! WAS SO......IMPRESSED, I PLACED 2 NEW ORDERS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. THANKS FOR THE SERVICES!",5
2978,This is one of the few places where you can still find the Michael Kors White Luminous Gold in the larger 3.4 oz bottle. I always have to be sure to order early around the holidays before they sell out! Amazing perfume! :),5
2978,I wanted to try something different so I purchased Michael Kors and it smells wonderful! Thank you so much!,5
2978,"I get compliments and questions, ""what is that sensational perfume you are wearing"", every time I wear Michael Kors White Lumimous Gold. I love it and the attention!!!",5
2978,I have a lot of allergies. This perfume is the best. I have been an Organza user for years. Tried all kinds. I could never be deterred from Organza until I got this as a small gift. Now I wear nothing else. ,5
2978,"I am a lover of Shalimar, Flowerbomb, Pink Sugar, La Vie Est Belle. It doesn't smell like anything I've tried before. Someone said it smelled like Sand and Sable from the drug store, but I strongly disagree. It's a very good floriental. I wish someone with a good nose would do a review. I love this perfume.",5
2979,"I bought Miss Dior Le Parfum a year ago, and not until a month ago, I had not wear it. Well, couldn’t believe it. So many compliments! And it stays the whole day long! I love it!",5
2979,"Miss Dior is a lovely fragrance but can be a little strong at first. It would have been better if the spray did not come out so profusely making it difficult to control the amount being used. That being said, I was surprised that my husband who does not like a lot of fragrances really loved this one! I bought the sample size to take with me when I travel.",5
2979,This fragrance is lovely and I received it quickly.,5
2979,My boyfriend told me about this perfum. And at first I didn't like it but it was because I tried Miss Dior blooming ( if am not wrong). But When I saw the perfum on the site I decide to buy and try it. At first it smell strong but after it's so good to wear it on. Lovely love it lol,5
2979,Miss Dior is such a lovely fragrance and stays on. Lovely compliments with this one. ,5
2980,Smells really good it reminds of Bleu de chanel. Smells amazing,5
2980,"This is a nice manly scent. It has a slight old school vibe, but it’s very relevant by today’s standard. It would be another pistol in any mans arsenal if worn properly. I have nerver smelled a scent that’s more evening than this. It screams nighttime!!!!",3
2984,"This perfume is lovely,long lasting and it makes statement everywhere you go.i have introduced my friends to this perfume and they're happy.",5
2984,Paco Rabanne Eau My Gold !!! I'm in love with this perfum . It smells sooo goood ,5

2988,"Prada Candy Kiss is my new go to, I have always Loved Prada Candy which is more on the sensual soft musky scent... This KISS is also sensual but smells so AMAZINGLY CLEAN, words cannot do it justice. LADIES if you are looking for a new perfume to try you must give Prada candy kiss a shot I guarantee you will love it.",5
2988,"I am a perfume lover and possess over 40 different fragrances. But when I discovered Candy Kiss by Prada it became my favorite perfume. I fall in love each time with the notes of its unique fragrance. It changes my mood and I feel sexy, elegant and seductive. I always get compliments and it lasts all day. I tell my husband that I don't think I will ever find another fragrance that makes me feel like this one. It is my match ",5

2992,I love this scent. Combines my favorite smells in one perfume. Snooki eau de parfum ,5
2993,Spellbound is another Estee Lauder favourite of mine. It is a gorgeous perfume. compliments an evening wear or daytime. It stands out in the crowd ... or at least it makes you stand out in the crowd. You know it ... when someone walks on by and they are wearing it. Just an amazing smell. A favourite of some 40years.,5
2993,Spellbound has been my favorite for 30 yrs always get compliments. ,5

2997,Versace Bright is good stuff,5
3001,Just tried this earlier this year and I love it! Its so unique and wears well throughout the whole day. Has a fresh scent yet a lil sweet too. And the price is always the best here! ,5

3006,I am very happy with my purchase of All American Stetson by Coty .,5
3007,It is for me . It is very strong and it wears out after a couple hours.,3
3007,"Animale Parfums is one of my favorite partum for many years. Unfortunately, I was unable to fine Animale for several years. My sister told me about your website, and now I go to your site several times a day to see what is offered. I love the selections that you offer with affordable prices. Thank you.",5
3008,"Hi there, you have no idea how happy I was to learn that you carry Anne Klein. for many years it was my signature perfume. I always get wonderful comments when I wear it. Wherever I go people asked me what I am wearing, they always say it smells so good. And I always answer, I know that's why I wear it. Thank you for solving my problem and letting me finding Anne Klein. ",5
3010,Bond no 9 cooper square is a fantastic fragrance and I really enjoy it and it has great staying power it projects about 2 to 3 hours and it lasts until the next day I give it a ten out of ten and have a blessed day ,5
3011,"I have to say Boss Pure is probably my favorite of all the Boss/Hugo colognes - and there are many contenders! Each of the Boss/Hugo fragrances are distinct and fantastic. As a description, Pure is a very clean, watery, oceanic fragrance. Once sprayed on, that is what immediately comes to mind. As a comparison it resembles Versace Man but 'purer' (no pun intended) and cleaner, more refreshing. Also somewhat like Dolce Gabbana Light Blue but not as heavy. Pure is long lasting too which is a plus. Highly recommended. ",5
3015,"Was weary at first, but soon swayed for the better as it was the real deal. Being an EDT, it doesn't stay as long as the EDP variant, but still lingers on the skin for quite some time and still a head turner wherever one goes. Definitely for those who enjoy a light and jasmine-y end notes that's not overbearing nor stingy. Be sure to have a good atomizer handy as this is a splash bottle.",5
3016,"I LOVE THIS PERFUME! I am a Lady who is well known for wearing expensive Perfumes. You can always tell if a Perfume is Wonderful, if BOTH WOMEN & MEN are Complimentary. I am a Professional, Very Social, and this is a fragrance that is full of Wonder. A little Mystery goes a long way. ",5
3017,I PURCHASED THIS COLOGNE CALLED CADILLAC ON TWO DIFFERENT OCASSIONS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE. ,5
3018,"Chamade was introduced in 1969 and it was simply feminine desire in a bottle. I desired it. The fragrance was a bit of a mystery as there was nothing waiting for me at home on which I could look up exactly what made is so magnificently wonderful. Then it was discontinued. But they brought it back, not exactly as it was but it's still an elegant fragrance. Quality of Chanel and the wearability is close to being the same. This is an elegant perfume but it works well with jeans, a man-tailored blouse and a great pair of pumps. It's divine.",5
3018,"One of the best mid-century Guerlain scents---it is elegant, long lasting , dressy and richly feminine. Guerlain is ALWAYS quality---but this one is uniquely beautiful!",5
3018,"Chamade was introduced in the mid-late 1960's and it was just wonderful. My mother wore it and for many years and it is a pleasant reminder of my childhood. My daughter who only smelled the scent once, instantly loved it and asked me to buy some for her. This is a great price for this product. I'm looking forward to smelling it again.",5
3018,"My mother always smelled so delicious and whenever I asked what fragrance she was wearing she would always say ""That's my secret"". I always found the scent intrigueing and didn't discover her secret until after she passed away in 1986. I found her bottle of Chamade, tried it and LOVED it. I have been wearing it ever since...It always reminds me of her and makes me feel closer to her. Whenever I'm asked ""What is that scent you are wearing, I always answer..."" MyMom's secret""! ",5
3020,Ordered it for the first time. My wife fell it love with it. It is an sensual scent,5
3020,"Black Wood by Cigar has a spicy, woodsy smell which is very attractive. It has a clean musky smell too, good to wear during the evening and in cool temperatures. It's definitely one in my favorites to go with my collection of Drakkar Noir, F by Ferragamo, Burberry London, Spice Bomb and Azzaro Night.",4
3023,This is one of my favorite scents love it ,5
3023,Great perfume! Can wear it anytime but probably best in the evening and onwards.,5
3026,"I got the 17R01 batch. It’s definitely authentic, I verified this with the lady at the Creed Counter I go to for samples. It has a very clean lemony, fresh scent almost reminiscent of Green Irish Tweed. Overall smells amazing!",5
3026,"This fragrance has 2-sides. The aroma this fragrance gives off is one of the most delicious, great smelling I have ever experienced. However, regardless of how much you spray, it really is very short-lasting. And, sometimes a fragrance's length of duration is more important than the scent itself. It's one of my favorites...though I can no longer purchase. I must stick with the fragrances that are very good, and also long-lasting... Aventus, GIT and Royal Water (which is just as suitable on a woman). Enjoy...",4
3026,"Been wearing Neroli Sauvage for close to 20 years. I feel naked without it, like a required article of clothing. I would highly recommend it, and while it's not overpowering, it takes on your own body chemistry to give you a fragrance that's uniquely you. Five stars all the way.",5
3026,"Creed Neroli Sauvage smells fantastic. The initial burst is all citrus, mostly lemon. This is just to wake you up. Then you get to the dry down and there's the ambergris and musk. Super clean smell as with most creed fragrances. It's true that the opening doesn't last long but the dry down is the best anyway. Get the 3.3oz tester. The price is great and so is the fragrance. ",5
3026,"It has a good smell and suptle,but it does not last long enough to cost as much as it does. I was very dissapointed.",2
3029,"Finally, my all time favorite scent in a body mist!! The last time I'd use Curve Wave was in 08 I believe and I felt absolutely beautiful and feminine. I could not find the perfume anywhere since they didn't have it in stores anymore,and now ten years later, I'm beyond ecstatic to have found it again. I would highly recommend this to all of girl & womanhood. Go and get it while it's still around.",5
3029,I love curve & curve wave is good. I will probably reorder some more curve in about 2 months. ,5
3030,If u love light blue u will love this. Not as citrusy but very sexy,4
3030,"Such a fresh, clean scent. A shame you only have the samples left. Wish y'all would get some more of the full size bottles in stock, please. The only bad thing about it is that I wish it had better longevity. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.",4
3030,D&G 18 la lune is a great fragrance. Wish they carried it in larger sizes.,4
3030,Order arrived faster than expected. LOVE the scent!!!,4
3032,"Man this Eclat smells so good. Went to a fragrance store in the mall, smelling different scents and came across this one. Never heard of it, but i could not stop smelling. It’s a toilette but last all day like a parfum or intense. I work 12hr in the heat in Georgia and smell it ALL DAY LONG",5
3032,Bought this perfume for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day. He loved it and so did I. It has a fresh masculine scent kind of woody as well. I do recommend.,5
3034,"Sweet but fresh scent, not overpowering, you will smell fresh all day!!! Perfect for daytime ",5
3035,"Samples this product and was actually shocked. Got 2 compliments, and 4 hour projections!! With 5 hour scent. So much bang for its buck, definitely a younger smell, someone in there late teen early/ mid 20’s. Very juicy and fruit but in a musky masculine way. Just bought 2 bottles, one for me and one for my buddy who complimented me. ",5
3035,Ferrari Essence Musk WHOA ! You gotta try this . It is awesome .,5
3035,Ferrari Essence Musk Now this is quality perfume for men . I reccomend it .,5
3037,I tried Giorgio Glam last year and have been using it ever since. I always get numerous compliments. I have used Giorgio's line of perfume for many years and just decided to try Glam. It smells great! I love perfume and cologne that I can also smell. Glam stays with you and I also smell it!! I absolutely love the Glam scent. ,5
3037,Smells very romantic and not too heavy Nice fragrance I’d buy again Gaylene King ,5
3037,"I ordered Giorgio Glam after smelling it while Christmas shopping. Couldn't find size & price I wanted locally. Friend suggested your website. Easy order, reasonable price, quick delivery. Definitely 5 stars!! ",5
3038,One of my favorites. Gucci by Gucci body lotion,5
3039,"Hana Mori is a wonderfully soft and elegant fragrance. It is not overpowering, softens and deepens over the lifespan of the perfume. I like to pair it with Philosophy Fresh Cream (which works beautifully for me), which helps bring out the woodsy end notes sooner. I am 53. I think it would work for any age. Sophistication and elegance are timeless. ",5
3039,"I couldn't believe how beautiful this was when I received it. I love the fragrance, it is so light and goes with everything. My granddaughter just loves the beautiful case and wants it for her room. Well worth the money and a really nice gift.",5
3040,I purchased the Hanae Mori EDP 3.4 oz bottle along with the aftershave balm and a deodorant stick and let me tell you something. It gives a man a reason to feel confidant about himself because people notice. The key is never over do it just spray it where your bodys pulse points are and let nature take over. Don't buy the EDT because that is just two parts perfume to three parts alcohol. This cologne definitely has a masculine scent. And is resilient even through the heat of the sun. Trust me the ladies appreciate it and you'll know it when you find yourself conversing with people who normally would not talk to you if you were not wearing it at all. ,4
3043,"Love this scent. It's an enticing combination of sweet, exotic, and spicy, and on me at least, it lasts a very long time. Like no other perfume I have worn; it's my everyday-on-into evening scent. ",5
3044,"Just Cavalli New - This is one of those ""oh, baby"" fragrances. similar to my grandmothers discription of her first exposure to Aramis, as a young woman. Comes off a little strong at first, but just wait for the dry down. Strong and sexy. yep, thats it. ",4
3045,"I hate the L'intense version of La nuit de L'homme. It is an iris bomb, and in my opinion, has no relation to its older brother. It can be very cloying, and sometimes, even upon initial spray, and even drydown, gives me an upset stomach. I definitely do not recommend this at all. Buy the original LNDL, and save yourself the hassle. I'm stuck with 100ml of this, and I don't even know how i'll get rid of them. Very sad to see such a well-known name as LNDL get ruined by a such a flanker. Do NOT buy this, unless you like Dior Homme Intense, which is also an iris punch to the face.",2
3045,"La Nuit de l'homme intense, big-name even bigger disappointment! This stuff smells like a mixture of lemon iced tea and old women's perfume. #Neverblindbuy!",1
3045,"La NUIT DE L'Homme L'Intense is an awesome fragrance! It just has an incredible scent that's clean, masculine and fresh. Many attractive women have given me lots of compliments! Guys, don't pass on this one. Girls love it!",5
3045,Im sorry but I DO NOT like this fragrance it makes me sick to my stomach I dont like the opening and the drydown is worst DONT BUY THIS FRAGRANCE BUY THE ORIGINAL and this is coming from someone who really wanted this fragrance to be a hitter also the intense is a exageration as well.,3
3045,"La Nuit De L'Homme L'Intense by Yves Saint Laurent is fantastic! Definitely shares many qualities of it's cousin, La Nuit De L'Homme, but is unique unto itself. Masculine and sexy for sure. Don't pass this up if you've enjoyed the original La Nuit De L'Homme!",5

3070,I bought my Spirit Aftershave because I needed a small bottle of aftershave for my trip to China. It's refreshing and I know the women I'm going to meet will love it that's how confident I'm about it. It's differently worth the price. ,5

3084,I’ve worn Aromatics in White off and on since it was introduced. When first sprayed it’s strongly spicy and floral. But it dries down to such a beautiful subtle fragrance. I highly recommend it as a great choice for us ladies that like our fragrance to be a little different. It’s definitely not one of many fragrances that smells just like so many others. ,5
3084,The Aromatics in White is such a delightful fragrance. I sprayed it lightly and the day after it was still pleasantly there. ,5

3103,"Dunhill has done it again with London. This is an awesome fresh fragrance with red apple, tonka, and vanilla which makes this fragrance sweet, but still masculine because of the sandalwood, musk and patchouli. There's a hint of rose and jasmine but I can't smell the geranium. The longevity on my skin is about 4 hours (not bad). This fragrance is good value for the price. I consider this an excellent ""cheapie"" and worth the purchase. I blind bought this one and I'm glad I did. I recommend picking up a bottle for your fragrance collection. I give this an 8 / 10.",5
3103,Dunhill London is great,5

3107,"I have only used the Fancy fragrance, by Jessica Simpson, for a LONG time....I get alot of compliments on it! So when a gift set was available that included not only a full sized spray parfum, but also the body wash, lotion, and a purse sized atomizer, for LESS than just the price of the parfum, I ordered 2! Usually, such lotions and body washes smell nice, but are rather rough on your skin. I was SO pleasantly surprised to find that the Fancy body wash left my skin not only smelling wonderful, but it actually made my skin soft and smooth. It also lathers up well, just using a small amount. This order, I just mainlined the LARGE sized Fancy body wash...lot's of great showers, coming up!",5
3107,Love it!!!!! Best ever to use...,5
3109,very nice perfume!!! Recommended,5
3110,"I started to be selfish and not give this a rating because I wanted to keep this fragrance for myself and not let anyone know how delightful this fragrance WHITE TOUCH by FRANCK OLIVIER smelled,I couldn’t do that because it smells soooooooo GOOD that I want the world to know that FRAGRANCENET HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!! I don’t understand why no one has tried and rated this yet. I take a lot of chances with FragranceNet because I do a lot of blind buys on fragrances that’s how I am able to tell people about the different fragrances I buy off FragranceNet and no I am not rich, when I’m on line shopping for fragrances on FragranceNet I look at it as a type of therapy for me so if I’m feeling down I just hop on line and start looking for new fragrances that I haven’t tried and start playing Russian Roulette again and try something new and so far I haven’t struck out yet, so Thanks Again FRAGRANCENET YOU SOLD ME ANOTHER WINNER!!!!",5
3111,"I bought this cologne and the first time I wore it out I was asked numerous times what I was wearing. Women really love it, I have been told it is a great scent for the summer, light but masculine.",5

3113,Love the scent very smooth and a Calming,4
3113,"Harajuku lovers wicked style baby is by far my FAVORITE perfume out of the entire collection. Aside from being so darn cute it has a unique smell to it that I really can't compare to any other perfume. I'ts sweet, girly, sexy, flowery, fruity, musky, vanillaish (not overly sweet) and powdery all at the same time. I have purchased this 3 times and def plan on purchasing more. Iv'e read reviews of people bashing this perfume but honestly everyone's body chemistry is different and on me this makes me smell like a Goddess.",5
3114,This is my second order which came fairly quick and exactly as I expected. I'm going to order another item and know it will be handled as my others orders and I know I will be pleased. I have nothing but good review for fragrance net.,5

3115,"Ines De La Fressange is a beautiful fragrance, nice mix of flowery and woodsy but not heavy either way, just very pretty. I bought the sample first then the big bottle. It's great if you want something that is not mainstream, light and elegant. No one will know just what you are wearing but will think it is lovely. This makes a great gift as well. I do wish the scent lasted longer.",5
3115,Smells clean and fresh... yet soft and delicate like flowers. I purchased the mini vial and now I'm purchasing the large product. I really like this smell. ,5
3115,"It smells different when it goes on but dries quick and the scent sticks around for hours but not overpowering. It's a nice smell, feminine. French.",3
3117,"This is one of the most unique fragrances I own and I am crazed for it. First of all it's VERY hard to find. The last bottle I had was purchased for me by a Swiss friend who brought it back from Zurich and it was close to $200. I swore I would pay that much again IF I could find it because the Swiss friend is back there permanently. Fragrance net didn't have it when I searched in the past. Imagine my shock when I found it available and SUPER affordable! I ordered it in a heartbeat. It is the real deal. This is hard to classify because it is so unusual. There is a tobacco element to it -- not the stinky cigarette smoke I abhor, but the sweet scent of the raw plant. It's lovelier than it sounds. But to put it in the ""Tobacco"" category makes it sound too masculine. This is a feminine scent but in typical German fashion, not sweet. I can't say enough about Joop! Le Bain and I hope fragrance net keeps getting it over and over. At this price you can go for it. It is so amazing. ",5
3118,It’s the best classy and wonderful beautiful and I love it I’ve been using it all my life I’m excited to use it again it’s in a class by itself you shall see have a wonderful blessed day ,5

3120,"Kenneth Cole Thermal is definitely a well kept secret. I was reluctant to purchase a new fragrance for my husband, because of his loyalty to Dolce and Gabbana. He was pleasantly surprised and very pleased with his new cologne, after years of commitment to only a few fragrances! ",5
3121,Definitely not what I expected. ,3
3121,Kim Kardashian's True Reflections is a beautiful scent. It smells like flowers and powder. It's a light everyday scent. I love it.,5

3171,Good powdery sweet scent.....got some nice compliments wearing it....,5
3174,"Armaf Italiano Uomo very nice scent, but I prefered the Black version. ",5
3177,"""Si"" by Giorgio Armani is a soft, feminine fragrance that brings forth loads of compliments from both men & women whenever I wear it. I love how the aroma lasts a long time; a little actually goes a long way (the perfume, not Eau de Toilette version). I was immediately drawn to the scent of ""Si"" when I ran into one of my cousins. After complimenting her and inquiring about its name, she told me what she was wearing. I've been wearing it ever since, thanks to my youngest brother who blessed me with the entire set (3.4 oz. w/body lotion & bath gel) a couple of Christmases ago. In my opinion, this scent can be worn year-round. It is completely amazing & delightful and my favorite fragrance for now. It may be expensive, but I'm worth it! ",5
3177,"When you first spray this on, it is extremely strong. Almost overpowering. As you wear it, it becomes subtle. In fact many people tell me that they can't smell it unless they get quite close to me. I haven't driven any men wild with it yet, but I am hopeful. The more I wear it, the more I am liking it. My go to scent is Hanae Mori Eau de Toilette. It gets the most compliments from both men and women.",3
3177,"When I first sprayed si by Giorgio armani I hated it. But right away the scent changed into a beautiful citrus flowery with awoodsy undertone. I bought it blind because of all the good reviews. A lot of men like this scent. It's supposed to be a spring/summer scent, but I think more cooler weather because it smells like cozy beautiful flowers in the woods. If you like coco mademoiselle then you will like this. ",3
3177,Very Delicate and complimentary Scent. Lasts quite a while. Lots of Compliments.,3
3177,I got the SI & I do like it a lot I've always been a fan of Tommy Girl but I really like this 1 & so does my husband :-),4
3178,Intense long lasting scent for a manual working environment. Skip the formals with this one. Lacks finesse.,3
3178,I can only hope they would strengthen this a little more; and then it would be great!,4
3188,"bylos body lotion is the BOMB I have been wearing for years. it absolutely does the job. you enter the room, people know you are there, but they do no know what HIT EM sophisticated lady I have the perfume and other products. ",5
3188,"Byblos is one of the most underestimated scents. No Cotton Candy smell, no sweet vanilla here... just a sensual flowery yet unique fragrance. Never ""perfumy"", never ""Lemony"" and definitely not spicy (although that's what I read). It smells more like white roses and Orange blossoms. And it stays. It's really a signature scent. People remember you by this crisp, unique perfume. Try it. I'm not paid to say this! I'm just afraid they stop making it... like my other perfume: ""Le ""De"", Givenchy... Oh, and everyone I've ever met who smelled it asked me what it was and loved it.",5
3188,"Byblos lotion is the perfect accompaniment to the perfume Byblos, more of this intoxicating perfume scent.",5
3190,"Does anyone else think this smells like Deseo for Men by Jennifer Lopez? Unlike Deseo, Carlo Corinto Classic gives me more longevity, easily get 8 to 10 hours. Perfect Summer fragrance if you're tired of the usual Summer mall fragrance releases. ",5
3190,"Repeat user. If you liked Gucci Nobile, this cologne is a very close second. Great smelling and lasts all day. Highly recommend it..",5
3190,Just love this cologne. Last very long and smells petty good.. Danny Gutierrez,5
3193,"CHEAP & CHIC LIGHT CLOUDS Is one of my favorite scents, one of my friends told me about it, and also sprayed on me, I fell in Love with the scent is not to strong and can be use during the day and night, smell fresh all the time specially in a hot day, I just wish that instead of Eau De Toilet you should offer in a form of Eau De Perfume because has more percentage of perfume, either way I Love ❤️ it !",5
3193,"I love this scent, it was a blind buy for me and I was so excited when I sprayed it and found that it was a scent I liked. Very soft and floral and feminine. Great for any time of day and is not super strong. I wish they sold the 3.4 oz bottle, I would recommend this scent to anyone who loves florals. ",5
3198,Cool Water Into The Ocean - this is the top for my younger son.,5
3198,Cool Water Into the Ocean was a blind buy and was a disappointment. It does smell pretty exact to the original Cool Water but on the dry down it's more fresh and less strong yet the longevity is really bad. I need to spray at least 7 times to actually smell yet it fades away after around 20 minutes. There is still an aroma but only if you literally press your nose against your shirt. I don't even get the pineapple or melon notes. I wouldn't buy it again nor reccomend it. Loved the shipping duration though! Would keep buying from this website for all my fragrance needs.,1
3198,Very refreshing and I love putting on in the morning. Great way to start the day,5
3198,It works best during the summer out at the beach. Cool Water Into The Ocean is one of my recommended fragrance for the hot summer ,5
3199,Very nice. Lite subtle fragrance ,4
3201,"I've been wearing Derek Lam 10 Crosby Drunk On Youth for a while now and it's just timeless! I got it for my little sister, too! It smells sophisticated AND fresh. Perfect combination!",5

3212,"I noticed the only other review has been rated ONE STAR. Well, I think that is massively unfair. This perfume is simply delicious, and is, as all 'Euphoria's' go... FIVE STAR! Pure elegance in a bottle. I have had many compliments while wearing this perfume. ",5
3212,"My mom loves both the original Euphoria and Euphoria Forbidden which is sweet and very nice. However, Euphoria Deep is absolutely horrid, it smells like a cheap car scent one gets at the carwash. Glad I only paid $29 for it because it will be going straight in the trash ",1
3215,Smells great for summer. Thick notes of passion fruit & florals. If you're from somewhere warm this would be a great thick memorable fragrance. I love it. Great for any occasion. ,5
3216,hilfiger woman candied charms is lively and lovely . I enjoy wearing it ! Stays all day ,5
3219,"The best!!! Love, love, love it!!!",5
3219,"Judith Leiber's NIGHT is elegant, intoxicating, evocative (1930s cocktail parties at the Plaza or the Ritz, where women were dripping in diamonds and men wore tuxedos), long-lasting, mysterious, addictive....what more can I say? I am hooked! It's the best scent I've ever used. It smells rare and costly. I hope I'll never be without it.",5
3219,Judith Leiber Night is the perfect scent! A date night scent that you can put on in the morning to tantalize his senses and will last all day so that he is snuggle close at the end. This perfume isn’t well known so my coworkers are not wearing it as well. It’s just mature enough my daughter won’t steal it and floral enough my mother won’t be tempted to use it. This has become my signature scent. I feel bold and confident when wearing it. ,5
3219,"Judith Lieber Night is spicy with a subtle sweetness. Sharp start, definitely an adult fragrance. Dries down to a mellow warm cinnamon/vanilla. ",4
3219,The best perfume anyone can own it smells expensive and beautiful and last for hours ,5
3222,Kim Kardashian's GLAM fragrance smells the best. I tried this scent on a whim. I figured in my mind it would smell great because of the fancy bottle and it does. I would recommend this fragrance. I love the way it smells on me. ,5
3222,I love this fragrance. It is soft and fruity. Great for any season or occasion. ,4
3222,"I have been using the fragrance for a few years now because I LOVE not only the way it smells,I. LOVE the way it smells on me! I got a better price on it even with s&h than where I usually buy it. I also even ordered a different Kim K perfume, again great price, love the scent, and I didn't have to wait a month to get them. ",5
3222,I received my order of Kim Kardashian Glam and must say that it isn't as strong a scent as I expected. I've gotten many compliments of people telling me that I smell good and want to know what I am wearing.,4
3222,"This fragrance is classy, cool and clean. Just as beautiful as the lady who created it!",5
3223,"L'Artisan Seville à l'aube is a rich, creamy citris with orange and bergamot. The bergamot, I believe, lends its spark of green. Underneath lies a base of incense and maybe some amber - which gives the fragrance its creamy, warm depth. ",5
3225,a great value--thank you --i saved a ton of money buying from you--came right on time--no box but same great lotion--thank you and i am refering you to many friends,5

3226,This perfume started my obsession with perfumes when I was a teen. I still love it.,1
3226,"Lady Stetson is my daily preferred cologne! I discovered it several years ago and I have worn it since! I spray it on just to be in the house, and I wear it when I go anywhere. Understand, that I grew up wearing Chanel 5! So, I am very selective when it comes to colognes. Lady Stetson is my 'go anywhere, anytime' cologne!",5
3226,I ordered this for my mom we searched everywhere for this and couldn't find it untill I found you and the best part of this was when I gave it to my mom it made her extremely extremely happy I have also ordered HERO cologne for men which ive been trying to find for many years thank you your awesom,5
3227,"Love this! Excellent overall fragrance. Longevity, silage and scent.",5
3228,"Les delices is an amazing scent, amazing bottle!!! this smells like fresh strawberries dipped in caramel. But at the same time it is so light and fresh. Not at all heavy or cloying. This is my 1st Nina Ricci perfume and if this is any indication of the brand I cant wait to try them all!!! Thank you fragrancenet for carrying products I cant find anywhere else and at a great price :)",5

3233,Masculine rose all day long.,5

3240,Amazing price for Marc Jacobs perfume! Can't go wrong ordering through this company!,5
3240,"I purchased Rain by Marc Jacobs, without even smelling it first! I was never so happy that I did. After receiving it, I loved it SO much that I literally went back on the site to purchase two more! I'm not a flowery or powdery perfume person. I like watery like smells, sweet smells, this is definitely not flowery or powdery! It's great, I love it!",5
3240,Mac Jacob Rain has been one of my favorite fragrances for a long time and it was not in stock for quite a while I was so excited to see it offered again it just makes you feel good when you wear it and I always get so many compliments. ,5
3241,"The bottle was much smaller then expected, I had purchased this perfume (MariaSsharapova) before and it was bigger but I am satisfied with this product nonetheless. It's one of my favorites and it's unfortunate it's so hard to find and get.",5
3241,Been using this fragrance for years. Pretty much the only fragrance I use now. Love it. Get multiple comments all the time about it. Highly recommend. ,5

3251,This fragrance is really light. It smells fresh and feminine however it does not last long at all. A few hours tops! You must reapply ,3
3253,Great smell that lasts for at least 24 hours. ,5
3257,Good stuff. My coworkers love it. Perry Ellis Aqua is good..,5
3258,Very unique and masculine scent that I only wear for special occasions where close intimate company would appreciate the intense and luring fragrance. I get compliments all the time and provocative responses from unrelated company. ,5
3258,Great deal. Very quick delivery.,5
3258,Pheromone is any mans secret weapon of indication. Miglin captured lightning in a bottle. It's a head turner for all the right reasons.,4
3261,"play intense awesome scent my room mate love it, long lasting too",5
3261,by far my favorite scent. I have dozens of perfumes but this is the one I would choose over all of them. I always get soooo many compliments when I wear it. I think it has a light floral scent but not overpowering. It's perfect. My go-to fragrance for all occasions. You won't be disappointed. The Play Intense (purple bottle) and Play (pink bottle) are completely different scents. I don't like the original Play (pink bottle) that much.,5
3261,Givenchy Play :Intense is a distinct scent for a mature lady on the town ........ with a playful side. Not over powering but a little last all day. I wear it to work on fridays so that I'm still smelling good at happy hour. Not flowery and a side hint of floral.,5
3261,"This scent is my favorite! I do not like floral or fruity/sweet scents and this is not one of them. The ratings on this fragrance are close but not exact. This really is not Oriental/Spicy, it does have a little floral note but very subtle. It is clean, fresh, sexy, spicy, romantic, all that and then some. I wear this daytime, nighttime, anytime and I get compliments wherever I'm at. Doctors office, work, the store, from men and woman. It is not a powerful scent a nice light but yet long lasting lingering scent that all seem to enjoy. I'm hooked and I love my Spicy, Woods, Leathery scents, this is my favorite! A Leathery scent I love is Blvgari Black a unisex fragrance. These are my 2 favorites. ",5
3264,"My husband has been a musician since a child and plays a mean lead guitar. I bought this product simply because it has Hendrix on the box. When it arrived not only was it great because of this reason, but it smells great as well. What a pleasant surprise!!",5
3265,It is a feeling of warmth!!!,5
3265,An amazing fragrance. It's fresh and makes you feel happy. ,5
3269,"I got both, the perfume and the body cream, if I knew that the body cream was unique (it really captivates the fragrance) I'd have save big bucks because Sisley is very expensive in general and that perfume was not worthy. By the way God bless FraganceNet!",5
3270,"Top tier baby!!!! If you want a high end projection, and smell for less look no further. Very unique, and awesome!!!! Don’t be suprised if people do a double take! One of my favorites!",5
3271,I ordered this for my Trekkie husband. It was perfect. We both like the light sent of Teberius and the fun idea.,5
3272,"This is something an old man would wear when going to church. Very clean scent. Sillage is soft, not overpowering, longevity is below average. Smells good but I won’t but not for someone under 45 years old. ",3

3276,"TL Pour Lui is one of the best of the best cool fragrance. It has an exceptional charming smell that lasts, and you will not want to use anything else. It is so good and soft; I am in love with it and people I cross on my ways always admire and congratulate me for the aroma and always ask me for the name. Nice eye-catching aroma that lasts and lasts for days. It is fresh, soft and so masculine. This is the kind of aroma women always like to sniff on their men. ",5
3276,"This is a cool fragrance. It lasts and you will not want to use anything else. I fell in love with it and women and men like it on you. Nice eye catching aroma that lasts and lasts during the day or evening. So fresh and masculine, yet not overpowering. You must love it or hate it. I love having been introduced to this master piece. It should be made available in the states!",5

3281,"The perfume is beyond what I expected. Nice fresh clean smell. Not , sure what I thought it would smell like. I like the bottle and decided to give a chance, and , I am so glad I did. ",5
3282,"I knew I was getting a tester, and as such, the bottle is not suitable for gifting because it’s missing the decorative top cap and pretty box. But the rest of the bottle is beautiful, sprayer works great, and the fragrance is authentic and smells great. Definitely get it if it’s for yourself.",5

3283,My name by trussardi is a very lovely soft floral perfect for warmer days and can be office friendly. I recommend ,5
3283,"Trussardi creates some lovely fragrances and My Name is no exception. Starts out a bit potent but soon dries down to a softer but certainly not invisible scent. I see My Name as a bright, party fragrance with excellent staying power. One of my favorites.",5
3283,I first purchased this fragrance (My Name by Trussardi) while on a trip to Italy. I was upset that I couldn't find it in local department stores. Buying it here was fantastic. I paid double the price for a smaller bottle in Italy. Thank you for this lovely scent. It's soft and romantic.,5
3284,"If you love powdery fragances then you will love this. It's like a talc in an expensive floral perfume set, very elegant. It's not loud, so if you like your perfume to announce itself to the room, then this is not for you. Beautifully subtle, your partner will want to snuggle closer to inhale your scent, but also long lasting. I highly recommend this fragrance and it was such a bargain from Fragrancenet!",5
3285,"I absolutely love Vanilla Fields, it has been quite some time since I have worn this wonderful fragrance. I don't remember why I stopped wearing it, but I have taken care of that. It is light, and refreshing and I have received so many compliments on it. I shall make it my number one fragrance to go to. ",5

3301,"Bvlgari mon jasmine noir is a clean, classy scent. Not to sweet, more of a clean scent in my opinion. I normally like clean scents Like 5th Ave. Vivid by Liz Claiborne etc. I hope this helps someone looking for a nice scent. ",5
3301,I was pleasantly surprised by this scent. I have other Bvlgari scents and wanted to try this. I really loved the bottle too. It was not a strong scent but definitely something I would wear for a romantic evening. I really like the subtle sexy smell it has. The bottle has a nozzle that opens and closes after every use. Classy is the word that comes to mind to describe this perfume.,5
3305,"I purchase all of the Davidoff Cool Water line of fragrances and I love them all. They are all fresh outdoors scents each with a different twist. I recommend them all if you like a fresh, understated scent that is never overpowering.",5
3306,"I LOVE Brittany Spears Curious!!! My daughter got it for me one Christmas, and I have been buying it ever since. As an asthmatic, it's hard for me to find scents that don't set me off. This one fits the bill!!! I'd recommend it to everyone!!! 100%!!!",5

3328,"Highly recommended. It's fresh, fruity and mild. I've been a fan of Elizabeth Arden's Green Tea for years. This is a great alternative to it. It didn't trigger my seasonal allerigies which is super. *This can be used by women of all ages. ",4
3331,I had just ordered a bottle of this. It was a blind buy but the bottle was so pretty! The scent is nice but a little too musky for my liking and I really tried to convince myself to love it. I ended up gifting it to my mom. ,4

If you're looking fore a subtle to moderate perfume strength with a bit of flower patchouli smell then Twilight is the one for you. I will order this again and I do suggest this for any age. Birthdays and Holidays are perfect and of course for the Twilight fan in your life. ,5

3366,Wonderful light fragrance. I wear it to work as it is light and not over powering.,4
3366,I bought this having never smelled it and that's never a good idea. For me it's a bit harsh so if you suffer from allergies maybe it's best to pass on this one.,2
3367,Like it! Very nice!,3
3367,"I am so glad to have found this scent from Playboy. I work as a caregiver for a good friend's bedridden mother and she's quite sensitive to very strong scents. This one is very nice & mild,and sometimes I'll spritz some on her after her bath. She loves it too,and her relatives all enjoy sitting and cuddling up next to her. My bottle's halfway finished but no worries,I'll be buying some more quite soon.",5
3367,"I wear this Playboy scent mostly to classes and in my classroom,there's no air conditioner so it can get a little hot sometimes. I don't like smelling other people's body odors so I make sure to spritz myself as much as possible. Even my teacher liked the scent and asked where she could get some. Play it spicy is the best.",5
3367,"I'm probably the only one here that actually loves this perfume. Yes,I agree it's subtle and less spicy but for me,it's also a clean & natural kind of scent that people are drawn to. Play it spicy by Playboy is quite good for an underrated scent.",5
3367,"I like this scent,however,it's barely noticeable on my skin whenever I take a whiff but if I spritz the nape of my neck,behind my ears or on my clothes it works much better. Suitable for work,church or just running errands. Spicy? meh....not so much. ",3

Luckily,I tried it from a tester first before purchasing and wow,it's unbelievably long lasting,and a lot more on the flowery/spicy side. I also bought Charlie gold as well,now that one's a beauty. Revlon certainly has an array of great fragrances designed for the everyday woman in mind. ",5

Revlon certainly has an array of great fragrances designed for the everyday woman in mind.",5
3380,"I can't tell you how much compliments I've gotten since I started wearing this perfume. I always tend to lean towards green/natural or light floral scents and She by Revlon's got it all. It's sort of hard to find these days but I guarantee you'll not only smell wonderful but you'll get great value for your money too,when you try She. ",5
3380,"What a lovely fragrance this is. Very cheap for the price,and not everyone knows about it,which I love because that's what makes it so unique. She by Revlon is great for anytime,day or night,and anyone young or not so young. (I personally hate using the 'O' word). ",5
3380,"I've never heard of this She perfume before,maybe it's because I'm too caught up with all the other trendy ones out there. It's a very beautiful scent for any occasion and certainly not bad for the price either. Also, it kind of reminds me of another perfume called White Camellia which is no longer made. ",5
3381,This is one of my favorite fragrance (Spark) that needs to return in the 3.4 oz bottle and bath gel. There are not many fragrances that mixes very well with my body chemistry but this mixes very well. ,5

3403,I love this fragrance. One of my favorites! ,4
3403,"When first put on, I didn't like it. Then after a few minutes I thought it might be nice. Then the scent started to burnt my nose for the next several hours. I won't be wearing this scent again. I could still smell it on my shirt 24 hours later. Scents I like to wear, Versace Bright Crystal. Burberry Brit Sher. L'Eau d'Issey Eau De Toilette spray. Hope that gives you an idea about whether this scent is for you. ",1
3403,A Scent Florale By Issey Miyake is a delicate floral that entices the senses. It can be subtlry memorable in just the right way. It is intriguing.,4
3403,"Issey Miyake Bought sample card, the fragrance is light, did not seem to have a lasting scent that I was looking for.",4
3404,"I have been wearing Acqua di Gioa, Eau de Perfume and Eau Fraîche by Giorgio Armani since they first came on the market! My husband loves them, I love them and people around me always ask the name of the cologne. I Hope these products don't get discontinued!!! ",5

3404,I had this fragrance before it smell so good the only fragrance my husband like me too where ,5
3404,Acqua di gioia is one of my all time favorites! I always feel confident and sexy when I step out with it on.,5
3404,"This is a strong fragrance, but not overpowering. It lasts literally all day. It smells fresh, a bit like the original acqua do gioia, but with sweeter notes. I smell melon because of the sweetness, but others smell fruity+vanilla. (I'm not a fan of vanilla, BTW.) If the weather is hot/warm, this fragrance smells the best. In colder weather it smells much more like the original, in that it smells like white floral/rose/soapy... With a very subtle hint of sweetness. It's not a bad scent, it just doesn't reach its full potential until the weather is warmer. Love this fragrance. By far my favorite summer scent. ",5
3406,I have the original perfume and thought I would try this. I love the fragrance of this perfume. Highly recommend.,5
3406,"I've only come by this perfume in the last few months and really love it! I love the compliments I receive and I love how it makes me feel! Great product, great service and great prices!",5

3406,"I recently ordered the Anais Anais Deluce Premier to try after only using the original more than forty years. I was disappointed and will not use it. It has a stronger smell and has a vanilla scent to me. I love the light fragrance of the original. Sarah Tatum North Chesterfield, VA",1
3406,Anais Anais has been my favorite since it appeared on the market back in mid 1980 - it's been my only fragrance and I have received many compliments over the years. The new product also has a very appealing scent and I am eager to find out if Anais Anais Premier Delice will go over as well - I personally find it very appealing.,5
3408,"Goddess and Golden were what I wore and don’t see Goddess? Yes, like the other reviewers mentioned wish she’d come back! I’d buy all three of these! Going to buy what Fragrance net carries for now",5
3408,"Well,looks like I'm not alone here. I've also been on the hunt for this perfume too. At least I got one,but what about the 'Goddess' one? Is that discontinued as well? I think Ms Simmons ought to step her game up and start reproducing these perfumes again,but in bigger bottles. Oh and she can put in the lotion and shower gel too while she's at it. ",5
3408,"I never thought I'd see this perfume ever again. I've looked everywhere for it about six or seven years now & every salesperson I asked told me they never heard of it or they stopped making it. I'm so glad I bought this again,I think I'll get at least five more bottles of it until it's really gone for good. Yeah,Dare me,I'll do it.",5
3408,This is the most amazing perfume seriously. It has a hint of coconut. And a sprinkling of honeysuckle and it is light and beachy. Mmhmm i looked for this for 3 years and finally found it again.,5
3409,I like this parfume .,5
3409,Malachite is a fresh and beautiful fragrance. A great buy for the price.,5
3409,"Malachite is one of my favorite scents. I associate some perfumes with colors (don't know why), but this one makes me think 'green' maybe because it is smells fresh. The packaging is really neat, too, but even if that wasn't the case, this is still one of my top picks.",5
3413,"I fell in love with this perfume 20 years ago, it is great, everyone comments on how great ithe smells. Lasts long.",5
3413,"I bought this perfume about 20 years ago and it smelled really good. I could not find it anywhere. About a month ago I found it here. I fell in love with it all over again! This one can be everyday, work,or romantic! I'm very happy I found it!. ",5
3418,I Love Bulgari perfumes and esp. Red Tea. I like wearing something that most women don't sea.,5
3418,"i been using this bvlgari red tea since 5 years ago and i falling in love with it , i would highly recommend this to whomever loves natural smell .for me bvlgari read tea smells rich and classy ... not overpowering .. bvlgari red tea??? yes beybeh ..",5
3418,"Bvlgary red tea is one of my favs, the scent last for a long time and the best part is when you wear people notice that you smell good. ",5
3418,"I love this fragrance and have worn it for years. I have had a difficult time finding it and had been told that it was discontinued. I was so pleased to find it on this site. I actually purchased two bottles just in case. I always receive compliments when I wear it. It is a little unusual and I like that it isn't a common popularly worn fragrance. It is soulful, sexy, and sensual. I am thrilled to have replenished my stock!",5
3420,"I am thrilled to wear these Calgon Body mists. I've had a skin disorder since childhood and as part of my hygiene a mild soap,water and talcum powder was all I've really used. Perfume was out of the question because of its alcohol content. But now,I can wear these beautiful mists freely without any bad reactions. My personal faves are the morning glory and the Hawaiian ginger. ",5
3420,"Calgon body mists are the best. I love both the Hawaiian ginger & the Tahitian orchid scents. I even recommended them to a couple of friends who are nurses in the hospital. I prefer body mists over heavy perfume anytime because of my allergies. I don't know about the pear scent or if it exists at all,but it sounds delicious & I hope to try it soon,that is if I ever see it.",5
3420,looking for calgon body mist or spray pear fragrance,5

3423,"All smell great. A bit smaller than I expected, but perfect for traveling.",5
3424,"Have no idea why it has taken me this long to discover this nectar of the gods. It has so many bits of my most favorite fragrances........Chamade, Caprice, Jicky, My Sin, Chanel 19, even a drop of Bandit. But all so well blended that it is an entirely different fragrance. It has taken me a long time to discover it but I can promise that I will never run out of it again even if I should live to be a thousand years old.............ordering right now to make good on that statement.",5
3424,"Chant d'Aromes by Guerlain was the first fragrance I was allowed to wear, as a young girl. It is not heavy and I was surprised to see it described as meant for evening wear. I remember feeling very special and grown-up when I wore it and I would recommend it as a ""starter"" scent. It would make a perfect gift for a young teen-ager, although there is nothing wrong with wearing it later in life. It is beautiful and classic. ",5
3425,Chantal Thomass by Chantal Thomass are the best perfume. ,5
3426,"Love Red Sin by Christina Aguilera not real strong but if someone hugs you ,expect a compliment ",5
3426,This Red Sin perfume is fantastic ,5
3427,"Regarding Claris Eau Ressourcante ,I really like this refreshing , unusual fragrance and get frequent positive comments about it from colleagues and friends.. I do,not feel I have completed my toilette, until I have sprayed all over with this classy wonderful spray.",5
3428,"Clean Blossom smells so good. It is a fresh floral clean scent, with a touch of sweet sourness, which I enjoy in my fragrance. It is unique and something you don""t smell on everyone. I love It!!!!!!",5
3428,"Clean Blossom is one of the loveliest smells you could imagine. So crisp, clean yet exotic smelling. I love this sent and will continue to wear it everyday.",5
3434,I have had Green Irish Tweed for years. Tabarome is different than any other cologne that I have tried in the last 40 years. Not as strong as G.I.T. but very masculine. My wife loves it. I wish it would last longer. The scent notes are accurate.,4
3434,"I bought creed Tambarome along with other fragrance choices from FragranceNet and have been very satisfied. The Tambarome came to me damaged but I contacted customer service and they took care of the issue immediately. Once new bottle shipped, it was received in two days. I love FragranceNet and everything I've purchased from them!!!",5
3436,David Yurman a incredible fragrance I love the deep rich rose . I purchased this fragrance for my wife and I decided that it was unisex smells totally different on me than my wife. I love wearing this in the winter months. ,5
3436,I enjoy Limited edition by David Yurman it's a well blended bold rose fragrance in my opinion. It's not a sugary sweet feminine rose . That's why men can pull this off well and feel masculine in doing so. In my opinion the rose is a background player to a oriental woodsy type smell but nothing cheap . You will be noticed on my skin 9 hour's on clothes 12 plus hours. Silage 5 hour's great scent bubble . Men don't be mislead it's not a girly fragrance bit a very high quality niche fragrance that will totally surprise . I highly recommend this seller and Limited edition by David Yurman. Thank you Fragrance net ,5
3436,"I bought the limited edition pictured in the red bottle above, and it seems like many of these reviews were describing something else. Because the notes here are mainly rose oud, and the fragrance doesn't last. I haven't used it much yet, so I will test it more, and possibly mix it when wearing other fragrances that I have. I also bought a sample of the David Yurman by David Yurman perfume, and that has much better projection than this one. Love the bottle, will review again after I have had the chance to wear for awhile. Can't beat the price on his perfumes, or any perfumes from FragranceNet. I have been ordering from this site for many years, it is my favorite site. ",3
3436,"David Yurman limited edition in red bottle I bought recently is not what I suspected it smells like gasoline. I will use it in my dogs room to freshen it up ,my Pomeranian loves it. No wonder it's a limited edition. ",1
3436,"David Yurman (Red), is by far one of my favorite fragrances. Every time I wear it, I get compliments. One friend asked me, “what kind of thousand dollar cologne do you have on”? It smells that good. You won’t be disappointed.",5
3437,Deauville Pour Homme by Michel Germain is my all time favorite everyday cologne,5
3437,"Everybody likes this scent, men, and women. Its light yet so fresh. I would wear it every day but I like so many fragrances. Made in France. ",4
3437,"People ask what I;m wearing, must like it. I feel good in this cologne.",4
3440,It is exactly what I ordered and here in just a few days. ,5
3441,"This was a blind buy, haven't seen this fragrance anywhere else. Reviews stated it smelled something like 4711 which I really like but it doesn't last at all. This might last a little longer but not much, very good for a summer day when you want to smell fresh or use just after a shower for a light fragrance.",4
3442,Cartier Vetiver Bleu turns heads with its lovely warm but clean refreshing smell. It is a go to fragrance for me! I wear daily... and for another man to walk by and say it smells like I have gone to heaven...is quite the complimett!! Most ladies find it appealing and I am constantly being nuzzled just to get a smell. One female coworker said that it made me smell like more man! The reaction to this fragrance in my office has ben quite amusing! My reaction well before I wore it work was I love it...it inspires confidence and class. Sorry for those reviewers who were tunred off by the scent. I find it stimulating and quite attractive!,5
3442,"Eau De Cartier Vetiver Bleu, is not what I am expecting...",2
3442,The Cartier Vetver Bleu Its is not my scent to be honest. It is more for men than women. I will gift this perfume to my son. I am sure he will like more than me.,2
3442,Eau de Cartier Vetiver Bleu is terrible! It smells like crushed leaves to be honest. I was hoping for the smell of vetiver but was disappointed! Thank goodness I didn’t buy the big bottle! I don’t recommend for either sex! ,1
3442,Cartier Bleu....s!Ella so good!!!!!!!,1
3445,Definitely elegant! This scent is for them special occasions! Very strong but elegant!,4
3446,"Masculine, refreshing and great for any environment!",5
3449,"Gucci Flora Generous Violet, the name says it all. Strong violet floral that settles down to a light floral with a powdery base. I love all the Gucci Flora sents. ",4
3449,Gucci Flora makes me feel light as air and refreshed every time I wear it. Perfect light scent for summer.,4
3449,"Gucci Flora Generous Violet - Not everyone likes the true smell of violets. I do and I am happy with this light, fresh fragrance. It is subtle but lingers nicely. I find it excellent for the office where so many people complain about other people's perfumes. I will buy this fragrance again.",4
3452,"Smoky, spicy, some citrus, it doesn't preform well on the skin maybe 30 minutes, but on clothing 5-6 hours very alluring scent, but for the price you can't beat it...Zirh Ikon ",4
3452,"I could not believe the price i bought this cologne for, less that $12 bucks and the (ROI) return on investment is incredible i get big compliments and if i take off my shirt and pick it up days later i still smell the cologne on that shirt, makes you want to just walk around and smell yourself all day, lol!!!! ps love the magnetic top. love ikon zirh",4
3452,"I am really starting to enjoy wearing Ikon. At first I thought the incense was a bit strong, but I think it was just unfamiliarity. It is very complex and always smells intriguing. It has been perfect in the winter and I am interested to see how I feel about it as it warms up. I think Ikon is a great value.",5
3457,Love JOOP Miss WILD!!! This is the only place I can find it now. Used to buy in a retail store but have not found it there anymore! The price is right! I switch from JOOP for Women to JOOP Miss Wild all the time! Delivery is awesome and you always have it in stock! The scent is woodsy and I love that!,5
3461,"Bought the lotion, love the scent so much, now I will buy the perfume!",5
3464,I have just started buyiny through this site and my daughter and I love it we already brought Kim Kardashian pure honey/still from Jennifer Lopez/Nicki Minaj/simply belle and love them all...and trying to buy one once a week!!!,5
3464,"Kim Kardashian Pure Honey is okay, but I wouldn't purchase it again or even as a gift. After reading the reviews I figured it would be a great fit for me as well, but the cent is not for me. The bottle is very pretty & a great touch!!",2
3464,Kim Kardashian Pure Honey smelled more like Pure Laundry Detergent. The presence of ‘clean’ aroma chemicals overwhelmed any possible distinction or balance. The honey mostly presents as a lightly cloying sweetness on top of the overpowering scent of synthetic cleanliness. ,1
3464,I really like the clean and fresh smell of this fragrance- Kim Kardashian Pure Honey-but it does not last on me. Nice summertime fragrance tho,4
3464,I love this fragrance not overpowering but just right you can wear it everyday its subtle and soft.,4
3469,"I gave both Laura Ashley No 1 Body Mist and Laura Ashley No1 Eau de Parfum as a gift recently. It was instant love with the first sniff. I hit a Home run with this... By the way, I also enjoyed the scent on her as well, very nice...",5

3469,Just came today. Love ir. Nice fragrance. Thanks for having it and such a fair price,5
3470,Live Irresistible (the pink one) smells WONDERFUL I LOVE IT!!,5
3470,"I also have the EDP version, and I like both. The toilette is a bit less intense which makes it more versatile. Very predominant pineapple and raspberry - this version has caramel while the Parfum had more pineapple and a praline note. It's a fun fragrance, very slightly similar to Absolutely Blooming by Dior, for the raspberry floral combo. They're not the same but if you like one, I think you'll like the other. The Parfum is more alongside the line of La Vie Est Belle with the praline and fruity floral, again not the same but if you like one, you'll probably like the other. ",5
3470,Very good service and fast delivery.,5
3474,"I am a vanilla-holic.. I also adore Tihota, but for everyday use its too expensive. I get a lot compliments on this fragrance and have bought it many times over the years. This is my second holy grail of pure vanilla's. It's a true soft, creamy, rich and long lasting vanilla without any of the annoying and overpowering scent of pungent flowers/powder..etc. Thank you for carrying it at a great price as well!!! ",5
3474,Ilove this vanilla scent is concentrated with a hint of oud or smoky i think is sweet but is not a typical high school girl sweet is more adult sweet sexy and feminine good projection last long is not too loud so is good for every day specially summer for me yummy def getting a big bottle ,5
3477,"Best described as sweet, green and fresh. 360 Blue is very different from the rest. The candy like fragrance is almost addictive. Maybe not the best of Perry Ellis, but definitely in the top three. I like it ! ",4
3479,Love Pheromone! Pleased with purchase. Will continue purchasing my fragrances from Fragrance Net!,5
3479,"Pheromone is hard to find, but I get compliments every time I wear it. Because of its intensity, I use it only in winter or or as an evening scent. I can now purchase it on a regular basis: your prices can't be beaten!",4
3480,This scent smells so amazing like warm vanilla edible almost. The only thing for me is that the scent doesn't last long (3-4 hours).,4
3481,"Parfum spray, body lotion in a cosmetic bag. Elegant yet discreet. Smells amazing, first try of the Pitbull Woman range. Will certain try more in this brand. Buy with confidence perfect gift for the lady in your life.",5

3516,"Azuree by. Estée Lauder is an amazing fragrance. The female equivalent of Armani’s is how I would describe. I use to use this over thirty years ago, but unfortunately we can not get in Australia, so I am happy to know that I can get through the fragrance net.

3521,Chelsea Flowers (Bond No.9) - all I will say is people smell me before they see me and know I am there. The absolute best fragrance ever. ,5
3521,Chelsea Flowers is a perfect purfume. I love the dry down fragrance that occurs several hours from the initial spray. It lasts and I keep smelling it to remind myself of it;s interesting scent. Wish they made body powder to go with this fragrance.,5

3547,"Eau de Rochas Fraiche is a wonderful fragrance! I, my mother and my sisters love it! It is a citrusy and feminine scent that can be worn in the Summer as well as during all seasons. It gives you a clean, fresh and feminine scent that is smelled by you and others and, yet, is not overpowering. Simply said, you feel clean, with a delightful scent of freshness that is, yet, quite sophisticated!. And, at least on me, the staying power is amazing (e.g.,when I shower at night and spray Eau de Rochas Fraiche, I can definitely smell it next morning). I have receive many compliments when I wear this perfume. I love Eau de Rochas, but Eau de Rochas Fraiche is also one of my favorite scents. I highly recommend this perfume!",5

3548,"I have been wearing this fragrance since it was first introduced in the early 1980's and it's my favorite! It's light, lemony, refreshing and NOT one of those that makes you hold your breath when you smell it on someone. This fragrance is nice on everyone, male and female, of all ages. Annick Goutal was a genius, as is her daughter!",5
3550,"Elie Saab Essence No, 7 Neroli is a great rendition of this usually too floral scent, with just a touch of clove to make it interesting. I don’t know what strength of scent an “essence” is, but this has very little longevity. Great price, and I’m glad I got a big (100 ml) bottle!",4
3551,Escada Especially Escada Elixir is a wonderful smellng fragrance. Clean and crisp with beautiful middle notes that are intoxicating. Will definitely recommend ,5
3551,Escada Elixir has a nice strong fruity scent that will shout out in the first hours then slowly reduce but can still be smelt. Smells more like Escada Especially but on a more fruity scale and recommended for the evening or cold weather.,5
3552,Balmain Extatic - A great choice for a lasting scent. Compliments a professional image for daytime. Not your grandmothers fragrance.,4
3554,"Fcuk friction is just the ideal fragrance for anyone who can't afford those already expensive brands and all the new ones coming out. And the best thing about it is I can use as much as I need because number #1; It's got a coconut scent in it,who doesn't love that? #2; I don't get any screwed up faces from anyone,just smiley positive ones that indicate they love it and #3; the bottle is easy to carry just about anywhere for a touch up. Sure,it's a cheapo,so what? I'm the one wearing it not them. Too bad if they don't like it,but I love it and that's all that matters.",5
3554,"I absolutely love this fragrance Fcuk French Connection of The United Kingdom. This is a beautiful sent for summer time. I was in the hospital when the nurse came upon me to check my vitals. I was sleeping when she stood near me. With my eyes closed, I asked...what is that lovely smell & she replied, Fcuk Friction. I knew then that I definitely had to have it. I was hooked ever since!",5

3554,"I am absolutely stunned at how lovely this fragrance smelt. I confess I was never into perfume and all that girly stuff but all that has changed for good. Friction is the first fragrance I've ever loved and it certainly won't be my last. I see a definite repeat purchase very soon. Oh and don't worry,I'm not at all bothered by the designers' quirky name brand. ",4
3555,"I LOVE the smell of FCUK Friction however, this set is not worth it. The lotion smells absolutely awful and the body spray is pretty much water. If you are interested in getting this perfume (which I recommend), just buy it on it's own. ",2
3555,"""Fcuk Friction"" made the man in my life say that I smelled delicious. The coconut & the honeysuckle make this a winner. Love it!",5

3561,Fred Haymen 273 has been a favorite for years and continues to be favored today for day use and occasional evening use. A little goes a long way so only a splash is needed to maintain the citrus freshness.,4

3569,"LOVE it. It's not an obvious perfume-y scent. It's clean with a hint of warmth, like a freshly laundered and pressed cotton shirt. The scent smells like it comes from somewhere on me, not from a bottle. In no way overpowering, even if I put a lot on...mmmm! It lasts all day. I've gotten compliments every time I wear it. ",5
3571,I absolutely love the way this colognes smells on my man!!! ,5
3573,"Unlike many females, I do not have a signature fragrance. I just love perfume and trying scents I have never had. Incanto is a new fragrance for me and it is wonderful. My preference leans toward a spicy scent and Incanto did not disappoint. I can see where many would use this fragrance in the evening because it is somewhat stronger than most perfume. However, if I like it and I do, it will be worn day and night. In case you are interested, it is not strong nor overpowering.",5
3573,I love this perfume so much I wanna order more and make this my official new scent. I grew up with a sensitive nose so I’ve only just started using perfume and I have a lot of catching up to do. I bought this based off reviews and it was a good decision. It smells really good but it’s not overpowering. Perfect for everyday wear ,5

I now wish I had never given any away since I am down to my last bottle. Please get this beautiful scent back in stock. My nieces and grandchildren recognize me by this perfume and I constantly receive compliments from waitresses and others that I meet. I has such a clean fresh scent. Hope it will be available SOON.,5
3588,"Lutece is the best fragrance I have ever owned. I love it. It smells so fresh and clean. .I have worn it for 30 years. I hope they never stop making it, it would kill me.

It’s a different more nostalgic smell that triggers a memory, like you’ve been there before. Super sexy smell and stays around all day. All my friends immediately went out and bought a bottle. Turns heads with this scent. ",5
3589,"Love this scent, and so do the people that surround me! I bought the tester, its brand new just without the box. I will go for testers more often as they save money!! For me, I wear to work and for formal events, it goes well with my chemistry and is just an amazing balance...like an excellent pair of pants, they go well with just a casual tank top or with a pair of attention getter killer stilettos.",5
3591,"Marc Jacobs Daisy Dream Blush is one of his bests, wish it wasn't a limited edition or I had unlimited funds to buy all I could. Smells wonderful on me and I wear it all the time with no need to refresh. ",5

3607,"Penhaligon's knocked it out of the park with the Bayolea fragrance. I am a big fan of citrus and woody fragrances and this did it for me. The thing I like about all the Penhaligon fragrances is they don't fade after an hour or two. This scent is there all day and it is a fantastic combination of citrus, cedar, sandalwood and florals working in harmony with one another. Very pleased and highly suggest trying Bayolea.",5
3612,"Awesome products. Deodorant, after shave lotion, shampoo gel, and perfume.",5
3612,"Pino Silvestre Deodorant spray not only leaves with a nice clean scent all day long, it doesn't irritate my underarms like so many other brands have done to me in the past. Just remember, it's a deodorant and not an antiperspirant. We have had a fairly mild summer up here in New York so I haven't been able to se how it performs on really hot, humid days. It has become my favorite deodorant.",5
3614,"Playboy VIP-- My sisters absolute favorite perfume. Getting hard to find, but I found it here and a great price! Thanks",5
3617,Great product my granddaughter will love the sample bottles and the soft power scents.,4
3617,This is a great product!,5
3619,I first bought Shine in Spain after searching high and low for my favourite perfume after it had been discontinued. I love it..........it has a soft fragrance and I have been asked often what I'm wearing. It is GEORGEOUSE and at this price a giveaway. Dearer in the perfume shops in Tenerife. ,5

3620,Absolutely love the intensity and the aromatic fragrance of this perfume. Fragrance lasts for hours and it transports you to the markets of Morrocco and the middle east.. ,5
3622,I have been through so many bottles of Shakira Elixir. I will continue to buy it always. It is a favorite of mine. ,5
3622,"I sing in a church choir and as a rule,we have to wear the gowns but sometimes it can be very hot and sticky even the other members' body odors make it unbearable. So I went out & bought this elixir fragrance by Shakira and it made things a lot better for me. I can raise my arms freely and no one is bothered by the scent even if I break a sweat,in fact,they love it. Some want to know where they can get it. Love the cute genie bottle design.",5
3622,I love it it is one of my favourite perfume smells. Shakira elixir is a floral smell with a little spice its great!!,5
3622,"I was curious about this scent from Shakira. I mean I've smelt S eau florale,the original and the Rock! one. They all smell great but this one stands out for me. It's a very soft 'floriental' scent with just a hint of woods in it. Doesn't smell masculine at all and I like that.",5
3622,"I can't say enough great things about this perfume. It's a gentle,feminine scent and a pleasure to wear every time and everywhere. I used to be a Faberge lady back in the day but these days with so many new fragrances coming out it's quite dizzying for me as a retiree to choose something to suit my already limited budget. Shakira's elixir is all of that and more for me. ",5
3624,I love this parfum it’s excellent Solo Loewre Cedro,5
3627,"Sung Homme deodorant is a fresh, understated scent. To my nose, it's a mix of citrus and clean laundry. It doesn't have a lot of projection, so the scent is subdued and stays close. It's a perfect everyday deodorant. This style of deodorant container (where you rotate the bottom bar) feels cheap though, and I prefer a cylinder. But it's hard to complain for this price. ",5
3627,Love all of Alfred sungproducts on my husband. Prices are great on this site and delivery prompt,5
3628,"This is in my top 3 perfumes that never and I mean never give me or anyone else a headache. There are no chocolate notes. This is a frag for moms (or women who need a mild scent), not children. I have a son who has asthma and it has never bothered him. It is gentle and fresh. On me it is citrus plus a waft of honeysuckle or lily of the valley or jasmine. It is not sweet, there is no vanilla or chocolate (despite the name), etc. I live in a hot humid climate and this is never oppressive in the heat. I wear it to the beach almost every time I go. It gives the sensation that you've wiped down with a refreshing moist towelette or aromatherapy baby wipe. This was popular in the 90's among ladies in Japan and I'm still wearing it. I'm shocked that there are no other reviews. Hidden gem!",5
3630,Mandarino Di AMALFI by Tom Ford: Strong orange / citrus scent for the first 2-3 hours and rapidly dissipates from their . The scent was gone within 6 hrs. I would rather pay more for a longer lasting more mature scent. Try some on for a day or night before buying. There is a lot of hype about Tom Ford colognes in my opinion. ,3
3630,Live the fragrance. It is a very light fragrance and even though it lasts only 3-4 hours it still smells really good.,5
3630,"Tom Ford Mandarino di Amalfi is my new fave scent! From its gorgeous citrus opening to its cool clean dry down, this frag has me under its spell the entire time. I sampled this one before purchase so i was aware of its rather short (3-4hr) longevity. Still my fave!",5
3632,"This is a very elegant fragrance, my friends love it as I do, I recommend it specially for girls or women specially working in an office ",5
3632,Tous gold is a light clean scent. My husband really appreciate me wearing it.,5
3632,This Tous is just a wonderful fragrance without being overwhelming. You will love it and get noticed at the same time.,5

3636,"I love Untold Eau Fraiche! I had worn Elizabeth Arden Body Basics (later repackaged under the name ""Eau Fraiche"") for years in the 1980s. When I could no longer buy Eau Fraiche, I was very disappointed. Having done a recent online search to find something similar, I connected with a rep from Elizabeth Arden who told me ""Untold Eau Fraiche"" is the new version of my old favorite. I'm not certain it is EXACTLY the same, as it has been a number of years since I wore it, but if not, it is very close, and I love it. I'm very happy with the price and service of FraganceNet as well, and will do business with them again!",5
3636,"I ordered Elizabeth Arden Untold Eau Fraiche from FragranceNet and I couldn't be happier with it. The price was great, much less than others I found online, and they even ship a couple of samples of other products with it. I had used Elizabeth Arden ""Body Basics"" in the early to mid 1980s. They repackaged it, and called it ""Eau Fraiche,"" and I wore that for a few years. I always loved it. I thought it was long gone until I found Untold Eau Fraiche. It may not be EXACTLY the same as the original, but if not, it's very close, and I love it. I'm so happy I ordered it, and will order from FragranceNet again!",5
3639,"My new favourite! It is a beautiful fresh fragrance for everyday or evening as well.. I have received many compliments while wearing this fragrance. I love to layer my fragrances to give a longer lasting scent, so I was happy to see the shower gel and lotion. My only wish is that the shower gel and body lotion came in a larger size. ",5
3639,"I have been wearing Versace Yellow Diamond since it came into the market. It has a very pleasant and feminine fragrance, making you feel glamorous, divine! Ready to love and be loved. I receive many compliments from my colleagues, women and men, and, very importantly, my husband loves it. I am glad the body cream and shower gel are back and I am planing to give the gift box to friends this Christmas.",5

3661,"I loved the Youth Dew Amber Nude and was so very sad when they discontinued it. I have a just tiny bit left, so I knew it was time to go in search of a new fragrance. I saw the write-up (description) of Amber Mystique and thought I would get a tester and give it a try. Ahhhh! I now have something that has a similar effect to my beloved Youth Dew Amber Nude. My husband agreed and bought me a bottle of Amber Mystique for Christmas (thank you, my sweetie!). I'd describe this as a floral with slight oriental tones. If you liked the old (original) Opium and/or Youth Dew Amber Nude, I think you'll enjoy Amber Mystique. Thank you Estee Lauder!",5
3661,This is Estees version of the youth dew Amber nude that Tom Ford made for Lauder that went out of production! I cried when it was discontinued and then found Amber Mystique. It smells just like it. I will be buying this out! Hope they don't discontinue this! ,5
3661,"I love this so much I am GLAD it is expensive and HATE to tell anyone what it is if they ask what I am wearing. It is mine, mine, mine! I have so many perfumes that I have to force myself to wear . If this had a body lotion or oil, my joy would be complete.",5
3661,"Estee Lauder's Amber Mystique is a wonderful fragrance. I always receive compliments when wearing it! It lasts all day and into the evening. I wear it anywhere, anytime. Love, love, love it! It is pricey, but totally worth it! Additionally, the bottle is beautiful.",5
3662,"Purchased this cologne 'scent unseen' if you will recently. Excellent fragrance as all from the house of Animale Parfums are. I was wearing it just the other day and it dawned on me, this is very reminiscent of Fahrenheit by Dior. Not as sharp or intense (no pun intended!) as Fahrenheit but could certainly be a 1st or 2nd cousin. Long lasting too. Highly, highly recommended. ",5
3662,Animale Intense is that fragrance that people compliment you on because it's smells so good! It lasts a long time and doesn't wear off easily. I am a fragrance lover and highly recommend this to everyone! The price is amazing.,5

In the 90's it came out again and a friend bought me a bottle, but when it came time to replace it it was gone again. I was so glad to find it here and bought a bottle. Slightly more floral than I remember it, but still with that citrusy undertone that I love so much. As a migraine sufferer I have to be careful what I wear....but this suits me just fine.",5
3700,One of my favorite perfumes. Was told it was discontinued so was happy when I saw I could still get it.,5

3714,"Ferrari Red is One marvelous fragance for mens, i recomend in summer season day or night...",5
3715,"Ferrari Uomo is massively underrated IMO. Its layers are evocative of the Tuscan countryside - citrus, wood and sweetened leather. If I were to draw a comparison, I'd say this can be defined as an inexpensive analog to something between Tom Ford Tuscan Leather and Dior Fahrenheit. Yeah - aside from its shorter longevity, it's that good. Easy dumb grab for such a low price.",5
3716,Most wonderful perfume. Have only had 1st bottle for 2 weeks and have ordered another bottle and body lotion. Use this day and night,5
3717,Love the scent!! So does my husband. ,5

3717,"Forbidden Affair is somewhat flowery but there's that Oriental scent in there which I think offsets the over flower smell. I usually like more powdery, clean, just took a shower scents and this one isn't like my usual perfumes. A very nice change and is one of my favorites to add to my small collection of favorites. This scent lasted the whole day on me and I received many compliments. ",5

3717,"I don't like strong fragrances; I feel a fragrance should be worn such that others only notice it when very close. I don't care for exceedingly sweet fragrances, or patchouli, lavender, or similar scents. I do like this fragrance; it is a bit sweet, but there's something that offsets the sweetness; it's not cloying.",4

3742,L'Extase Caresse De Roses Nina Ricci is my go-to perfume when I want to be enveloped in a sensuous charming luxurious scent. It is a ultra feminine scent. It feels very very expensive and yet the price is still affordable. I think of real velvety red roses grown and harvested in Grasse France when I think of this perfume. But it is not just roses. It is richer and more complex than that. I hope Nina Ricci never retires this magnificent perfume. The scent is real and gorgeous. I love it .,5
3742,"L'Extase from Nina Ricci. I was not familiar with this fragrance. I did some research to find out what florals were used in this fragrance. When I saw ""rose"" that tells me a lot. I am very happy with this fragrance.",5

3751,"I like this product. We've been using it in my family for three generations. Ity has lost some ""power ' compare to the original product made in Spain. Maja soaps have always been very good but the quality is diminished compare earlier similar soaps. The service from this company was awesome and got my soaps even earlier than expected. Keep up the good work... Gilbert",5
3751,"I absolutely love this whole line of Maja fragrance...I am of Spanish decent and almost all the females in my family used it. It is very difficult to find where I live (Charlotte,NC) and I'm thrilled I was able to find it online. Thank you, thank you! :-)",5
3754,"YSL Manifesto Elixir Intense is a gorgeous long lasting scent that has great staying power on your wrist, neck, decollete wherever you decide to spray it. The minute you smell it after the dry down you are in heaven. I cannot get enough of this wonderful scent, would love to wear it everyday, but that would be wasting it; because it is so elegant, sensual and beautiful, it should be saved for evening wear or special occasions. YSL perfumes are a great gift for you or a special friend who appreciates the finer things in life; YOU can't go wrong.",5

3773,"WOW! This is an amazing amber, sweet and smokey fragrance. Definitely for fall and winter. The way in which Lalique combines the accords and the notes is absolutely bang on. I haven't smelled anything like it. The green notes, combined with the sweet notes and tobacco... AMAZING! I can't get enough of this one! The cinnamon adds spice and warmth; and unlike other fragrances (with similar cinnamon notes), Ombre Noir has a smooth rounded cinnamon and not a rough spiciness. This is definitely niche and not designer! 10 out of 10 for me!",5
3774,Houbigant’s Orangers En Fleurs: I’m trying this for the very first time. I was looking for a a fragrance called Azahar and can’t locate it (made in Barcelona).

3778,"I like this fragrance very much. Some people were surprised that it's a Paris Hilton fragrance I'm wearing because one,it smells inexpensive and two,they always associate her with the glamorous and sometimes scandalous lifestyle. But the thing is it's very light,pretty,feminine and at a reasonable price. Can't complain at all,just a great buy.",4
3778,"Only for people very, very sensitive to fragrance. I smelled nothing at all. Too sheer for me!",1
3778,"Very nice scent. Not too strong or sweet,just fine. Wish it lasted a bit longer. ",4
3778,"Well,even though I'm not a fan of Paris Hilton,the person that is,I really have to give her credit for creating this lovely perfume. It's very light,fresh & citrusy and just about anyone can wear it. No matter where you choose to wear it, the sheer fragrance is a great choice and the price can't be beat.",5

3789,"Oscar de la Renta's Rosamor. I am a very picky type person when it comes to selecting a fragrance. I fell in love with it the first moment I could smell the lovely, enchanting, beautiful aroma. It gives me an air of sophiscation when I am wearing it, and also the many compliments that I receive from strangers, wanting to know the name. This is a fragrance, in my opinion, that can be worn anytime. ",4
3790,Royall mandarín Orange is a very attractive scent . Fresh and brisk citrus combination. I like to use it in the summer as it blends well with the citrus basenote eau de toilette varieties I use during the warm summer months. Great morning aftershave last’s about 2-4 hours . That’s pretty good for an aftershave . I give it 5 stars. ,5

3796,"very nice, feminine, sensuous but doesn't last long (maybe about 2-3hrs).",5
3796,"Jean Patou Sublime. Expensive but it is so worthy. As the fragrance wears on, it smells better and better. The aldehydes in this fragrance is not strong so the opening is mellow. The civet is mild also, which to me it means it is not mossy or manly smelling. Dry down is to a flowered vanilla not a sweet vanilla. Elegant. Don't need to spray a lot. You will not smell like everyone else.",5
3796,"Sublime- it is everything it's name implies. My sister worked in a perfume store years ago, and thats how I became introduced to this wonderful scent. It's like no other. People stop me in stores, in grocery lines and even in the dog park to ask what is that fragrance you are wearing and it really does smell wonderful. Every women loves hearing these kinds of compliments, especailly from strangers. Occassionaly I have found it in a mall specialty shop, but it is getting harder and harder to find .

3805,Touch for men from Fred Hayman,5
3805,I love this scent especially for summer. It's subtle and clean but lasts the entire day. This is definitely a mature scent. As always - less is more when it comes to the application of any cologne. ,5

I haven't smelled anything like X-Centric, it is truly one of a kind and that is why I like it. I love the bottle, too! Although a light aquatic, I love wearing this in the fall and winter months when it really emanates from you body heat. I have received many, many compliments on how good I smell. I don't think they will discontinue this as it is one of Dunhill's unique fragrances and bottles. I love it! It would make a great signature scent if you're looking for one that is unique. A+",5

3822,I live the acqua Chic it smells amazingly clean and fragrant,4
3822,"Alien Aqua Chic I cannot really lump it into one category. I can smell the citrus and the ginger in it, yet it also has a bit of the woodsy element to it also. I find it to be very feminine without being cloying. It is daring in a refreshing way. I highly recommend this perfume.",4
3822,"Bought this for my wife she loves it,get so many compliments on Alien edt spray",4

3828,"Great fresh , long lasting scent. ",5
3828,"I love Armand Basi in Red. It reminds me of Pricilla Presley's Indian Summer that has been discontinued. This is a great winter or dog-days-of-summer scent. It's wonderful, warm, and spicy! I will buy this again. It's a great stand-in for Indian Summer. If you loved that perfume, you'll love this one!",5
3828,"This scent is amazing and unique. I have been wearing it for years and get regular compliments on it, It is clean and fresh but sexy and not heavy. I don't understand why this is not one of the most popular fragrances on the market. ",4

Best suited for cooler weather and semi-formal and formal occasions. 3 sprays max and you will carry this awesome scent with you for at least 8 hours. Bogart fragrances are excellent performers and always at an awesome price point. This was released in 1975 but is still wearable today. Similar to Paco Rabanne Pour Homme. ",5
3840,"I was a bit hesitant knowing what I paid for the first bottle I got from Barney's. But I couldn't pass up the price and and am pleased. The Bois 1920's line up is filled with so many scents that I want. I started with classic, and just purchased the Agrumi Amari Di Sicilia....much deeper note with a citrus starter. My girlfriend buried her face in my neck for 20 minutes the first time I wore it. Awesome product, will be trying Sushi Imperale, or Real Patchouli next.",5
3842,"Bond 9 Dubai Indigo is in a class by itself. I have worn over 10 fragrances by Bond 9, but this one here makes every one stop and ask me what are you wearing! It is a head turner for me every time I wear it. If you don't have it, add it to your collection. Save up for it. It is well worth every penny.",5

3842,Bond 9 Indigo I ve always wanted a bottle of this but it was way too expensive elsewhere and frankly so unaffordable. The spell is a wow factor and I still can't believe I have it. The price here is fabulous and so are the products. The delivery was prompt and I had no need to follow anyone up so thumbs up again to a great company,5
3842,This was classified as a women's perfume for some reason. I'm a male who got this as a sample and fell in love. This is now my favorite from Bond No 9. It smells like an opulent blue freshness !,5
3842,Refreshing! very clean. Love it.,5
3844,Boucheron variety are classic scents. I enjoy Boucheron so much I wanted to see what the women scents were like. I’m glad because my wife is very happy with them. Very soft but yet very inviting. Thanks for the hubby points. Lol,5
3847,"OUTSTANDING the Fragrance is needed for the layering affect i.e. Perfume or Cologne. I am a spellbound by Estee Lauder person but, I am a Bvlgari customer for sure and I owned several of their fragrances. BVL Notte is my favorite of their's and then some of the other one's that I like. Doice Vita by Christian Dior is another one of my favorite for daily wear. Then there is Bvlgari most definitely.

3857,"D&G light blue escape to Panaera is lovely. This was a blind buy for me and I wasn't disappointed. It only has the slightest hint of the original Light Blue; it's got that gorgeous citrus scent. It's quite light and I'm gonna wear it in the spring/summer. While it is beautiful, the edt makes it ""weaker"", so it won't last all day unless you reapply. I will definitely be buying this one again! ",4
3857,Dolce and Gabanna's Light Blue Escape to Panarea is such a beautiful long lasting fragrance I get compliments all the time on this fragrance. I just ordered my 2nd bottle. I'm addicted to this perfume!! I would definitely recommend this one!!,5
3857,"I just wore this for the first time tonight and I really like it. It's very similar to the orginal, but more ""summery"" if that makes sense. Very nice! And it lasted all night long. A plus.",4
3857,"Every time I wear Escape to Panarea, I get compliment after compliment. This is by far my favorite next to Prada d'iris. It's a very light and sexy scent. Also the strength is very good considering it's an eau de toilette. I spray in on my clothes in the morning before work and by that evening I'm still getting compliments. ",5
3857,I love ❤️ my Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue Escape To Panarea. I always get asked what I’m wearing where ever I go! My Husband absolutely adores me when I have it on and I love the way it smells and makes me feel!! Love Love Love ❤️ ,5

3862,"I love Christian Dior dioressence , but didn't realise your price was American not Australian, so of course it was not that much cheaper. I was very pleased with your delivery didn't take that long to arrived, expecting another order soon from u should be here this week. It is my favourite perfume by far,. Thank you.",5
3862,While deployed in Iraq in 2007 one of my co-workers let me try Dioressence and I loved it. Bought a bottle when I went on R & R. Lasted me a long time and I received so many compliments on the smell. Then they stopped making it so every time I passed a fragrance counter in the mall or in stores I would ask if they had it but they never did. I'm so happy you bought it back but I'm waiting for my message saying it is back in stock.,5
3863,I was thrilled to order and receive TWO 3.4 ounce bottles of this great fragrance for the same price I had previously paid for less than one-fourth this amount! Received the fragrance very quickly. I am very pleased.,5
3867,One of my favorite colognes,5
3871,"Body Lotion Emozione, by Salvatore Ferragamo I stumbled upon this lotion by chance and just love it. The scent is amazing, no need to add any perfumes and it lasts for hours. I love it!! and get many compliments when I wear it!",5
3874,"GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD SHTUFFF, yes shtufff",5
3874,This perfume is by far the most amazing and unique scent I have ever encountered! I absolutely adore that it smells differently on everyone. It is like a gin and tonic poured on crisp ice with a touch of sweetness. It makes everyone crazy when they smell it.. I own so many perfumes but this is my signature!! It lasts forever!!!! Everyone will know where you have been. It lingers so beautifully without being overpowering!!,5
3875,"I originally received Oscar De La Renta's Extraordinary Petale as a sample with my Macy's order. For the first time in many years, I found myself obsessed with the smell. After receiving many comments, I decided to order and am so glad I did. My son says it reminds him of the beach - it's fruity and floral and has a decent scent life. Will definitely be reordering. ",5
3878,"This fragrance is quite strong, extravagant and far from comparing it with Coco mademoselle, which is fine elegant and seductive. It was a total error your purchase.",1
3878,"I simply love Fancy Nights. I've been purchasing this particular fragrance for years, and I make sure I'm never out of it. I wear it all the time. When I wear it, I receive a lot of compliments--especially from men!! ",5
3878,the best perfume I have used in my life,5
3878,"I love my perfume Fancy Nights by Jessica Simpson's. I found it at a store in Columbia SC but then they didn't get anymore in so I went on line to Fragrance on line. The found the cologne and gift sets. Then my sister, friends and people would stop me in stores and ask me what my perfume was. I am now ordering my sister the same she loves it too. We have always liked and wore the same cologne.",5
3878,"I always buy Jessica Simpson, I love that fragrance. I bought it when it first came out, I've been in love with that fragrance for years. It goes with me.",5
3879, One of the best parfum in my opinion. Long lasting. It was a very good price . ,5
3879,Very nice soft and sensual smell. Light musk scent. Smell lingers on clothing long after it's taken off. ,5
3882,"great summer scent, not to powderi",5
3888,"I had ordered a total of 5 different scents all by Elizabeth Arden. 4 of them arrived in original packaging. This one was out of plastic, and the inside cap is cracked. I'm slightly disappointed as this was intended to be a present. Will be contacting the company to see what they can offer to replace it. ",3
3888,"I love this fragrance every time I wear it,people always ask what is that you are wearing it smell really nice. I am buying me another bottle and one for my mother for christmas.",3
3888,Green Tea Exotic by Elizabeth Arden is a great fragrance. Had a lady at the market ask me what I was wearing because it smelled so nice. Spicy and sexy...and my husband likes it. ,5
3890,Lovely scent and a great buy.,5
3892,"Hugo Red : it’s awesome. My husband thinks it’s his new favorite perfume. As for me it’s perfect for cold weather- warm and spicy, lasts long enough. My friends recommended us Hugo Red and we are glad we’ve bought it. ",5
3892,"Excelente llego en buen estado, el aroma es genial lo recomiendo",5
3892,A neighbor of mine was wearing this and I liked it so much that I asked what he was wearing. Hugo Red. I had to buy a bottle for my husband ... this was several years ago and I still love it whenever he wears it. By far the best mens cologne I have ever smelled,5
3892,Purchased Hugo Red while traveling in Europe on business. Great long lasting fresh clean scent for all day and night. Found it in US only online-worth looking for!,5
3892,"It's a very pleasant smell, perfect for a date but subtle enough for office use. It's not too fruity but the hint of grapefruit does just what it was intended to do. HUGO hit their target on this one, compliments everytime I put it on, even from guys...",4
3893,I am disappoint with Incanto Amity. It's a lovely scent but it fades so quickly. ,4
3893,"I bought this Salvatore Ferrogamo Incanto Amity, just by reading the scent and I wanted something I knew no one owns. I just received it today, and I instantly feel in love with it. I bought the 3.4oz bottle, and the price was perfect as well. It shipped right on time, and the packaging wasn't damaged. I will be ordering again. I am sincerely happy with my order.",5
3896,Intrusion by Oscar De La Renta is Awesome !!!!,5
3896,"I really like the smell of this, but it doesn't seem to hold the fragrance very long, It seems to be a lighter fragrance, and I like the stronger fragrances better. I probably won't buy this again.",3
3897,Intrusion was misnamed- there is nothing rude or abrupt about this lovely fragrance. Wonderful!,5
3905,"I use it after shower and it gives a fresh scent. As it wears off outside because it is not overpowering, your skin retains a fresh scent of newly bathed and that is what I like the most. I have a picky friend who detest perfume and she liked this scent on me, so I feel happy to found it.",5
3906,"I began using this product when I was in my early 30's, which puts it at approximately 20 years I've been using this product! I've found that you can mix & match the basic fragrance, ex: L 'Eau D' lssey, Florale, Summer, Original etc... with this Perfumed Cream, They all compliment each other extremely well. I personally use the cream as my base, Spray the ""Perfume"" on the base {in each area} then give a nice spray all over with the ""Eau De Toilet"". I'm good to go... My scent stays strong for hours! Never over scented either! Ya really cant over do it, in my opinion, the fragrance is just Lovely, a Beautiful Fragrance! The key to its longevity though is this Body Cream!! Its Amazing! ",5
3910,La Violette by Annick Goutal is fabulous - just beautiful.,5
3910,"Being a first timer here on Net, I only ordered the try me but believe me, the full size will be on my next order. If you love pure violets, this is definitely for you. Gorgeous.",5
3910,"I love La Violette! It smells like the most gorgeous purple flowers you can imagine. The subtle, sweet violet scent with a hint of rose bursts into your nose like the first day of spring. Not cloying at all, or ""old lady"" in any way, this perfume makes me happy whenever I spray it on. ",5
3910,La Violette by Annick Goutal. Excelent! elegant and simply the best.,5
3913,"I was looking for a parfum with a rose scent, so I bought this one and wasn't sure about it. I LOVE it! It's sexy and romantic with a soft rose scent. It smells so good!",5
3913,Didn’t know if I would like but smells good ,5
3918,Marc Jacobs Daisy Blush is a beautiful scent. It is soft and beautiful and is perfect for any occasion. The top note of lily of the valley is noticeable. I'm attracted to this scent. It is so soft and beautiful and I feel beautiful wearing it. An all around nice and soft scent for any woman. I recommend this scent for all ladies.,5
3919,Marc Jacobs Sunshine. I love it!!,5
3920,Simply gorgeous all notes are superb,5
3920,Mauboussin j'adore et arrivée avant la date prévue. Merci pour les sample!,5
3924,"I wore Gucci Made to Measure for years, until I smelled this in a magazine sample. I went to Macy's to smell it in person and how it reacted to my body chemistry. I immediately fell in love! What I didn't love was the price. The 3.3 oz. bottle was $95 at Macy's and Amazon and even more when I searched online. Then I found this site. I was able to buy a gift set with the same 3.3 oz. bottle of cologne, Eau de Parfum not toilette, small mini spray and aftershave for almost $50 LESS THAN THE COST OF A SINGLE BOTTLE ELSEWHERE!! I also bought an extra gift set of the mini spray and bottle of aftershave. I keep one of the mini sprays with me if I ever need to reapply and gave the other to my daughter because she loves how I smell and she says it reminds her of me and comforts her. I purchased the two sets on a Monday and it arrived on a Thursday afternoon. I am beyond happy and satisfied with my purchase, quality and customer service. If you don't buy your cologne, perfumes and other scents from FragrenceNet you are simply wasting your money. I just wish I could give this product and site 10 STARS!",5
3925,"Montana Black Edition, first bought this by chance, because I've previously used Montana Red. Now it's one of my favourite colognes. The fragrance is just awesome and it stays with you for a very long time. ",5
3925,very happy with the smell and the bottle. I always use this product and recommed to all ages.,5
3928,Normals was worn by Thierry Mugler’s mother it was her signature scent. When you smell this you will see the similarity to Angel. It’s literally Angels mother without all the patchouli and chocolate. It is wonderful. I recommend it highly!,5
3928,"so romantic, make a strong impression on everyone. I love it",5
3931,"Oscar white gold is a lovely bit of spring or summer. The first spritz is a strong floral but it quickly settles in and the notes blend together so well, peach, gardenia, citrus blossom and lavender blend together and reminds of a much softer original women's Oscar. It is not synthetic smelling at all. Could be a nice wedding scent and definitely a bit of spring or summer when you are just fed up with winter!!. It lasts and the middle notes of jasmine, orchid, tuberose and lavender along with base notes of amber, sandalwood make it really expensive smelling and lovely! Really like this one!!!",5
3932,"Absolutely beautiful fragrance, my next favorite next to Layton.",5
3934,this my friends is the shiznit it drives women crazy ,5
3941,"Prada La Femme Intense. If you could imagine what Aphrodite would smell like. A NON gourmand, Sweet Rich Yellow and White Floral. With an Ultra Fine Sweet Patchouli. I don't care for Patchouli. This is just to give it sweetness. This has to be one of the most well blended perfumes. Nothing has impressed me this much in years. Wow, that first blast (20 minutes) oh goodness it's heavenly, then settles into a magnificent dry down. Sophisticated, elegant, sexy, feminine. This perfume is truly beautiful. But, one must be s fan of florals particularly Plumeria, Tubereuse, Ylang. In that order. The ylang in this perfume is rich, not powdery. This is the best price I've seen so far for a brand new 3.4 bottle. Delivery came in 5 days. So that was pretty cool ",5
3944,Quorum Sliver has an expensive smell that is not over powering but makes you feel good about yourself. For casual wear as it is not something that is high end except it has an stunning personality.,5
3944,This is a great scent that you can tell is expensive in comparison with the off the shelf aftershaves.,5
3946,"It is a nice smelling colonge, kinda strong when you first apply it. But when it settle doen it smells good.",4
3948,I bought Rock Me by Anna Sui in a small vial. The scent is so refreshing and I have been complimented on the fragrance. I will be buying more of this .Love this . ,5
3948,OMG this fragrance is so beautiful! Definitely top notch with my Alien perfume by Thierry Mugler!,5
3948,"I was browsing perfumes and looking at what was in them and found this one interesting. I ordered the vial to make sure that I like it before getting a bigger bottle. I really like this perfume. I get a lot of compliments on this perfume, especially from my sons. I will be buying a bigger bottle of this perfume.",5
3950,"Salvador Dali is an exquisite and elegant fragrance. When I wear it I feel very uplifted. It changes as time goes on, there are so many different aspects to the combination of floral and spicy elements. I am not surprised that it is sold out!",5
3950,"Can,t get enough love love love it.",5
3955,"Sexual Femme definitely projects a very sexual smell on a woman - mainly for sweaty, late night interludes...would not wear this if you are only interested in romantic cuddling... ",4
3955,Love the smell. It’s my favorite perfume. The smell stays on all day. I highly recommend it for those with an authentic taste .,4
3955,"I love it, I had many compliments on this beautiful scent!",4
3957,"This scent is AMAZING! Totally not what I was expecting, but it is warm, somewhat sweet and spicy. Totally worth the gamble!",5
3957,"So First, oh my! This was a blind buy and I'm so happy I did!!! I had used First, by Van Cleef & Arpels long ago when I was a young woman and I loved it. So, though I knew they were different scents, I trusted the brand and was willing to take a chance. So first is a warm, ultra feminine, absolutely divine scent!!! I'm in love!! And thank you fragranceNet for such great prices!!",5
3963,I love Tom Ford Velvet Orchid Lumiere. I love the sweet fragrance. I am planning to order the large bottle soon too. ,5
3963,Musky powdery goodness. I don't usually steer towards scents like this. I'm more of a gourmand scent person. But there is something about this that I literally can't stop sniffing it. Great for the fall and will stay on you all day long. I guess it's the perfect scent for someone like me that wants something different but can't do black orchid because it's a bit too much. This is it.,5
3967,I love Vera Wang Embrace! It's smells clean with out being over the top perfumy. Just disappointed that it was only available in the small roller ball size. Why is that?,4
3972,"My daughter's favorite scent was Victoria's 'Rapture'. I've been unable to acquire anymore. For a try something different, sent her Victoria's Secret Angels Only Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 oz for her birthday and she loves it. So this will be her new 'go to'. Thanks!",5
3972,"the angels only is not sold in the stores anymore where im from, so i get it off here, the price is amazing, absolutly one of my few favs that i have..... LOVE IT!!!!",5
3974,"I bought Adidas Get Ready for my boyfriend first time using it he loved it. It's not over powering, smells great. He's picky I've bought so many other colognes but he really loved this one. He even uses it for work. ",5
3979,Every time I wear this cologne I always get compliments no matter what time of the day always smelling good ,5
3980,"If you like Ombré Rose , you may also enjoy Junoon. They share similar notes and Junoon lasts much longer . This is a great fragarance , soft, feminine , powdery and suitable for many occasions . It is not a loud scent , but gently lasts all day and would be safe for work or office . ",5
3981,"Esta crema esta super deliciosa, aroma increible.",5
3983,Pleasant and a hint of flowers. I have The perfume and it is more intense and I prefer The perfume.,5
3983,"I've been wearing this scent since the late 90s. I remember having it sprayed on me in Selfridge's in London and not being able to purchase it in the United States for years. It is a the most light, unique scent...yet perhaps infused with powder almost (but in a good way). I will always be a fan and this will always be a favorite scent of mine, Angel Schlesser.",5
3984,"So, when I first spray Aramis Calligraphy Rose it's a soapy rose - like ""fancy"" soaps my grandma or aunts kept in the guest bathroom that you weren't actually supposed to use or touch. About 30 minutes in the spices really bloom and I also get more amber (and whatever else gives this a sort of dark feeling...maybe the Myrrh or Styrax or other notes I'm not too familiar with?) and it becomes more masculine too I suppose - though I think it stays unisex the whole time. This one is really growing on me the more I wear it. It lasts through the whole workday and then some I'd say 10+ hours logevity with moderate sillage. I'd say this is for the winter/cold days only. ",5
3984,I bought Calligraphy Rose with high hopes.... So so disappointed... the perfume is so so weak... a nice and lovely initial burst but 10 min later .... nothing... I wish the fragrance was as rich as the packaging!!! I thought it would be stronger since Armani's is part of Estée Lauder Johnathan B,5
3987,"I love it, I bought three bottles after the first one, wife love it to long lasting and seductive. Ohh Wee Man (Armaf Signature Night).",5
3995,Bill Blass for women and Bill Blass New..are elegant. ,5
3996,Black Panther smell great at a great price,5
3998,"I absolutely adore this fragrance. It's unusual, so you won't find that everyone recognizes it. It's natural, so it doesn't smell artifical, just clean and fresh. It's not too strong, so only those who are standing in your ""personal space"" will really know you have it on. My only complaint is that it wears off quite quickly. On me, it only lasts a couple of hours, even when I wear a non scented lotion underneath. I bought the hair fragrance as well, and I use them both. I smell it on myself, and it makes me happy - isn't that the point?!?",5
4001,"Coney Island is awesome! I have at least five different Bond 9 perfumes and this one is prefect for what I was looking for in spring and summer, I would love this in the body cream. I wasn't sure about the note combination, soooo surprised! I love this one!! ",5
4002,LOVE LOVE LOVE Liberty Island. I have 8 Bonds and this is my TOP go-to scent for daily wear. I’m on my 4th bottle and I get lots of compliments when I wear this. ,5
4003,"Bond 9 Musk is the best perfume ever! Do you want everyone to compliment you? Mix Musk with Angel and I guarantee you it will be the most unique smell. I never reveal my secret to anyone in a real life, enjoy and thank me later.",5
4003,"Bond No. 9 New York Musk is my least favorite of all the Bond scents. Although it’s marketed as unisex, it’s definitely masculine. This scent is far too overpowering to be feminine. I will not reorder this one. ",1
4003,Bond No. 9 New York Musk NOT fantastic for that price i expected more smell like a goat........,1
4003,Bond No. 9 New York Musk did not smell anything as described above. How would I describe it? I know! Have you ever smelled cat marking spray? Don't waste your hard earned money on this product. ,1
4003,bond-no.-9-new-york-musk/eau-de-parfum is a very nice alluring scent.,5
4009,Carmen Electra gift set is beautiful and smells great.... the perfume bottle is beautiful,5
4010,Did not like it..the best way I can describe the scent us chemically,1
4013,"I have been using Cool Water Game by Davidoff for six plus years. I absolutely love this fragrance and everyone tells me how nice it is. It is very fresh. It lasts all day but is not strong. I'm stocking up on this product now! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! ",5
4013,"Cool Water Game, I love the clean smell it has. I've been using this fragrance for the last 10 years.",5
4013,"This is my all day perfume. Use it every day the last 10 years. So many people tell me I have a verry nice perfume, nice smell that last long time. Its fresh and nice! Not strong or spicy. Lot of inspiration from the sea. I love this one! Any one can wear this ",5
4015,"Love, love, love the fragrance of Cool Water Pacific Summer! It's a light, uplifting, energetic and spicy. Makes the soul happy and nostalgic of gorgeous weather even if it's a gloomy day.",5
4016,This has to be one of the nicest fragrances I ever smelled. This is absolutely stunning. It is so classy and timeless. You will smell beautiful wearing it and will receive many compliments while doing so. It has great longevity and strength though it is never overwhelming or offensive. People will be asking you the name of this scent. I know. It happens every time I wear this scent. The cherry on top is the price. Top quality ingredients at 1/10th the price of some other scents out there that aren't nearly half as good. I love it!!!,5
4016,I have loved this scent since I first tried it back in the 80's. It is so feminine and it brings back wonderful memories. I get so many compliments when I wear it,5
4016,"Coriandre Parfume- Natural, different. A nice, fresh option for everyday wear. ",3
4016,"I have worn Coriandre as my signature scent since the first time I inhaled it's beautiful fragrance in the early 70's. As an intensive care nurse, it was important that we wear a clean, yet not overpowering fragrance. This was the one! Patients' comments were ""You always smell so fresh and happy."" HAPPY, a fragrance that could evoke an emotion. What a wonderful thing to say. I absolutely do not feel ""dressed"" without it. Now retired, it is still my fragrance. Many years after meeting someone, I would meet them again, their comment, ""I knew you were here when I smelled your perfume."" And the years just faded away. Thank you for making this fragrance available. It was very difficult to find at times, and no other fragrance could match it. I am so happy that it is available without days or weeks of searching. ",5
4016,I have known about this scent since the 1970's. I brought some a few years back but it was not the perfume and I was disappointed . I just recently found the perfume again and it is wonderful. I will be buying it again when you get it as well as the lotion. I do think it will last loner when you layer it. Thanks fragrancenet for the memories and hard to find scents.,5
4017,Creed original vetiver geranium a fragrance one need to try out is really great,4
4017,"I've purchased this fragrance before and thought it was a nice subtle scent, but lacked a few things, as I discuss! So I decided to purchase another bottle of Vetiver Geranium, since it was on sale, for a ridiculously low price! I'd consider Vetiver Germanium, a Floral Musk, with an obvious, woody scent, after dry down! The aromatics on release are fairly good, the projection is on the weaker side, and the longevity, could've easily been more. The best aspect of the fragrance is it's scent, or aromatics! The initial burst is really nice and the notes are definitely in play! The bergamot, along with apple & lemon, eventually dry down into a very beautiful, cinnamon & geranium marriage, along with a hint of rose. It's certainly not going to over power you! The top and middle notes blend perfectly together. The base notes are where the woody aromatics really shine, the mix is absolutely spot on - from the musk & cedar. The consistent hue of mint supplied by the patchouli seems to last for several hours (but not as long, as I'd like)! It's listed on House of Creed and other sites as a man's Parfum, but it's definitely unisex. I know a few women who wear this scent, and it works well with their chemistry! ",3
4017,one of my fav from creed i paid i think maybe $390 plus tax for this at saks and ordered from fragracenet to compare and it was the same so ive bought 3 or for more dif creeds from here and they are all 100% real ,5
4017,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY, YOU CAN WEAR THIS PERFUME ANY TIME DAY OR NIGHT, CASUAL OR OUT ON THE TOWN.",5
4017,"Just a quick note regarding the last review, check Creed's home site its listed as a fragrance for men. Smell fantastic.",5
4018,"Creed Fleurs De Gardenia is not a fragrance I recommend, and that’s coming from a true fragrance hound. Someone hit it spot on with the wet grass and pepper smell. That’s exactly how my daughter described it too! I also wore it around the house and hurried to finish off the bottle so that I wouldn’t be reminded that it was a Creed fragrance. Luckily, I bought a small bottle only to try. At least It wasn’t overpowering, but no need to spend Creed dollars for lounging at home. ",1
4018,It's a nice floral scent. A very pleasant smell definitely for the daytime. ,5
4018,"Beware of Creed Fleurs de Gardenia...it’s on clearance for a reason! As my daughter commented, it smells like wet grass, pepper, and old flowers. Dry down is a modicum better. But overall, very disappointing. However, since I wear perfume daily, and it is subtle and doesn’t last long, I can wear it around the house. But no need to spend Creed dollars for that. ",1
4018,"This is my second Creed fragrance. I do like it-- it is very flowery but fades into a more subtle fresh scent. After this bottle, I will see if I order again. ",1
4018,too flowery too much its bothers me very disappointed ,1

4037,It smells just like the name: a light pretty floral scent. Not too floral a little fruity but not to sweet. Perfect for a summer scent. I wear mist at home as they don't last on the skin very long. I also use it as a layer for other floral scents... it's light enough not to clash. ,3
4037,"Ellen Tracy's Pretty Petals is delightful. It's light and clean but noticeable. I love it so much, it is so refreshing. This was a blind buy, I'm glad I took a chance. I just ordered the perfume, I am so happy with my purchase.",5

4041,"The only one I've had the pleasure of testing out of this gift is the Remarkable People and it smells incredible! It is worth purchasing the whole gift pack for hat that one scent. Definitely unique. And it's hard to get without paying a ton for , very expensive so at this cost for the whole set is a steal. So based on price and the one scent I've used out of this I give it 5 stars",5
4043,Smells Great!! Would Love An Oil Version 4 stars because it seems to fade unless used again,5
4043,Give it time. I ordered this perfume awhile back and I'll be honest and say I wasn't that crazy about it to start with. I'm a huge fan of Britney's perfumes so I really thought this was the first Britney perfume that I wasn't crazy about it. I kept on using it and now it's one of my favorites because it really grew on me! I definitely plan on getting more when I run out! ,5

4062,"I received a sample of Jour d'Hermes while traveling to Paris last year. I decided to use it for a special concert I had there. The scent of this perfume surprised in such agreeably way, that since that day, when I want to feel the 'smelling' of Paris I wear Jour 'Hermes.

4068,"This is SOOOO great. It smells very very similar to Stella Rose Intense, which is selling for 300 a bottle now on other sites, if you can even find it at all. Not to mention, this exact perfume is NO WHERE online. This is literally the ONLY place I know it to be for sale anymore. It is truly the best deal I believe I have ever gotten on this site, and there have been many great deals. I love it so much that I immediately bought a backup. Once it is gone, it is likely gone forever. Don't miss your opportunity to smell Stella Rose Intense again. Best deal on the internet!",5

4080,I absolutely love Mancera black vanilla it’s magnificent. ,5
4081,"Intensive Aoud Gold by Mancera is a god send, especially if you love bright sparkly rose. This stuff is completely unisex to me. It may lean more masculine only due to the powerful silage. The opening is citrus rose. The citrus fades and leaves a bold clean rose. Undeniably rose- shortly a bright soft slightly cream wood note (oud) enters. I absolutely LOVE this juice! ",5
4085,Smells like curve appeal. This fragrance lasts about 2-4 hours,4
4091,Montale Paris Black Musk is great! Simple enough to layer when you wanna add a little musk to your scent. Slightly anamalic to keep it interesting but inoffensive.,5
4099,"Oscar de la Renta's ""Oscar Gold"" eau de parfum is a long lasting scent and is perfect for a day out or a night on the town. All of the notes come together for a fabulous scent that I love to constantly smell on my wrist. I even spritz a little on my pillow so I wake up with scent clinging to my neck and shoulders for a great start to the day. It leaves a woman feeling and smelling sexy no matter the time of day or what she is wearing. It meets my ""Gold"" standard for the parfums I will wear.",5
4099,Oscar Gold eau de parfum is a wonderfully delightful fragrance that stays with you all day without overpowering the senses. Every note comes together perfectly for a refreshing scent. This is my favorite fragrances by Oscar de la Renta and it's highly recommended.,5

4107,Perry ellis portfolio black smells like sweet success. Period point blank. Longevity and projection is great.,4

4109,Quartz is my choice since I remember.I love it. ,5
4109,Quartz by Molyneaux is the best and I've used it for years. The women love it!,5
4109,"Is not flowery, is more powdery.. Too classic. I would recommend for a conservative person",5
4109,"I have been using Quartz by Molyneux for over thirty years love iis flowery scent, good for everyday and evening. Always get compliments when i use it!",5
4109,"Quartz Moulynex the best fragance ever, fresh.",5
4110,"I owned this cologne a while back and was by no means a head turner for the women. If your going to buy this, know that it's just a casual scent and nothing else. Buy/Try/ or Pass I would try it as a sampler to see if you like it. I didn't like it on my skin but maybe it will work for the average Joe. ",2
4116,"Signature by St. Dupoint is probably just the perfect evening perfume, I first bought it in 2004 (3.4). Use it for those special evenings. There is a female version too. Both hard to find in larger bottles let alone this specific size. ",5

4117,Bonita botella buena opción para regalo y huele bien,5
4123,"I purchased this body mist somewhere else but I'm glad that this website has it too. I never tried Tommy Bahama before I absolutely love this fragrance. It has a nice soft floral scent mixed with a fruity smell. I like spray it on at home anytime or a quick spray before I go out. You can wear this with anything from jeans and t-shirt to dressing up. --Lorine, San Antonio, Texas.",5
4124,Also great. Nothing else need to be said,5
4124,Tommy Eau De Prep is a great product,5
4124,"Tommy Eau De Prep smells wonderful on my husband. It is not a true citrus smell as it also has a smell of sage, lavender and juniper. This is perfect for any age man.",5
4124,Tommy Eau De Prep. Has a distinctive fragrance that makes me think of Winter & the holidays. Absolutely love the smell & can't beat the price on here. Highly recommend for work & nicer occasions. ,5
4126,Quite a specially elegant and unique fragrance which is both attractive and satisfying!,5
4134,Love it! The bottle was a lot larger than I originally thought. So happy with my purchase & the fast shipping! Thanks a bunch,5
4137,"Whatever It Takes Kanye edition is kinda dope. It smells quality out the bottle and has a very rich and full blue scent. It could stand to last longer but fornow$12 I'm just happy it doesn't blast of pure alcohol at the release. I spray it just to smell it some times, good cheap fun.",4
4144,"I saw this product initially at a department store & as usual I went looking to see if Fragrancenet carried it & yes they did & of course it was way less than the department store. I layer this with another Rose scented perfume.....I love the scent of this rich body cream its feminine noticeable but not obnoxiously loud.....I don't think its winter appropriate only because the scent can get lost in the frigid northeast weather so I will be saving my cream for spring & summer☺I absolutely must acknowledge that I have been shopping on fragrancenet since 2003 & I love the customer service, fast shipping & product availability & prices.",5
4147,"Agent Provocateur Eau Emotionelle is a warm inviting fragrance. Luscious enough that you wish you could bathe in it. i must say the fact that you offer trial sizes on things i think is magnificent for the buyer. one can try it out before a larger and obviously more money purchase, and in the long run i would think you would actually get more sales, as i can know what something smells like, not stay away from it because of the price and i don't know what the fragrance will be like. i think the prices are great and hope to stay with you for years and years.",5
4147,"I ordered a sample of Agent Provocateur Eau Emotionnelle because I had received a sample of one of their perfumes a few years ago and wanted to see if it was the same scent. It was and I am very pleased with it. I love the warm depth of the fragrance. It's not overpowering, but it is definitely a scent that you would remember. I don't know if I would wear it on the hotest summer day, but it's a definite cool weather perfume. It's very feminine and smells like what I think a perfume should smell like.",5
4147,"Agent Provocateur Eau Emotionelle is a fragrance that’s soft, warm and alluring. The kind that is tempting but not overpowering. I feel very feminine wearing this scent. ",5
4147,"Agent Provocateur Eau Emotionelle is a delicious fragrance. I have ordered samples of almost every perfume on this site.. looking for that special scent that I could make my own go to fragrance. When I tried this one, it was love at first sniff. I have continued to sample others but none ever compares to this one. It is smells wonderful and I always feel very sexy and all woman when I wear this scent and men, all men , love it. This is one that I make sure to never run out of. ",5
4147,"Agent Provacateur Eau Emotionnelle is wonderful!! I opened the box, not 5 minutes ago and had to share. It is definitely sexy and sensual. I think it is definitely not for anyone under 30, but if you're a woman and still have a pulse, why wouldn't you want to feel sexy? I will wear this anytime and not save it for someone special or an evening of romance. I will wear it for me!! It is wonderful!!",5
4149,"Romantica, is one of my favorites ",5
4149,Anna Sui Romantica smells really good its very soft.. smells like flowers but not strong at all.. it's not over powering... very good for a date night or just a girls night out to have dinner & a couple of drinks... or a if u work in an office setting very good for that as well I wish I could describe the under tones but it's very flattering good for teen girls & grown women... I'm 35 & I love it I would use it as an everyday perfume for work... wish I would've got the 2.5 instead of the 1oz bottle... I think I'm addicted to perfume bc I can't leave without any I even have about 4 different bottles of different kinds of perfume in my car just in case I'm in a rush & I forget to spray before leaving the house... I actually find my Anna Sui 1oz at my local Burlington's for 9.99 & it came with a lil round purse wristlet that I use to keep my everyday touch up makeup in... I am about to order the 2.5oz now.. #GreatBuy #SoftSmell #VeryPleasingToOnesNoes & it doesn't irritate my allergies.. ,5
4152,One of the best ,5
4152,"Armani Eau De Nuit Oud Armani oud...amazing If you love oud, this is a must..strong and long lasting...smells amazing",5
4153,"Got Aura by Jacomo for pretty cheap. But after receiving, now I know why. It smells like I sprayed myself with citrus scented insecticide.",2
4153,"I saw the price and the notes on this fragrance; I was looking for a couple of Colognes different from the most popular brands.I bought it just before St Valentine's day. I just can say this is a very subtle, mild but deliscious Cologne. I was not dissapointed.",5
4161,Bond no. 9 new york sandlewood is great fragrance.,5
4165,Absolutely love! Will buy it again. ,5
4165,"I enjoy it, but I need a big size of it ",4
4165,Boucheron Vanille De Zanzibar--my new favorite vanilla!!! This perfume is amazing--a morphing scent on my skin that is office friendly and lingers all day--which I also love!!! A must-try for vanilla lovers!,5
4166,"Bvlgari Omnia Amethyste, I got this for my niece and she loves it I found I can't wear the Omnia sents but I still love the smell of them so I give them to my daughter my granddaughter and my nieces.",5
4171,Clean laundry scent. Id recommend it to a friend.,4
4171,"Very floral, and different!!!! It’s all about the dry down with this scent, but it may not be for everyone.",2
4173,"I purchased her original fragrance last year and it was so awesome, long lasting and beautiful that I had to try her Sublime. Beautiful packaging, amazing heavy and lovely decorated bottle is a beautiful addition to any boudoir fragrance display in the bedroom! This fragrance is also long lasting, although much lighter than her original. FragranceNet gives excellent coupons so it made my enjoyment of CH sublime much more enjoyable! Will order more!",5
4173,Carolina Herrera Sublime- I first came across this fragrence in the Southern Hemisphere on a Cruise Ship from Sydney to New Zealand. My only regret not buying more bottles. It is just such a stunning scent & lasts so long-definetly a must have item.,5
4179,"Commes des garcons It Is my smell, love it Cedar patchouli are my favorites",5
4182,Wow! I always wore creed Aventus but tried Spice and Wood just for something different. I have to say this is my new number one. From the first spray it was chosen without thought ,5
4186,"Melon and Lemon. Slight spices. But mostly lemon and melon. Relaxing. Vacation vibes. Declaration DNA. I wish it would just shout all day, but it stays moderate-smooth. ",4
4186,Blind buy based on reviews from other websites and a recommendation. Starts off waaay to floral for me. Smells like something my mother wore when I was a kid. Once it evens out it's ok. Good for a casual setting just to smell clean and high spirited but I don't expect any compliments off this one. ,4
4190,"I love the smell of it, but I wish it came in a box or a top on top of it, I gave it three stars because no box or top if it had eighter one I would have given it 5 stars ",3
4192,"Dunhill 53.1 N has a sunny sweet Smokey rhubarb vanilla tonka bean scent that smells great for work,or any occasion it doesn't last long or project but eight sprays would do it a sadly discontinued item but you can get it here on fragrancenet while it lasts thank you for fragrance net 8.5 out 10",5
4192,Dunhill is a perfume very good and perfuct for anyone and casual for any time,5
4192,This is a new one for me...but I have liked all the Dunhill fragrances in the past. Think I have tried them all with this one! Any of the scents get compliments every time I've worn them!,5
4195,"Very soft, mild and stays longer. I have ordered this same bottle for atleast 5 times. Best fragrance ever!",5
4195,"It is just beautiful, I love it!",5
4195,people stop me all the time for this perfect ,5
4195,"I bought the toilette spray elsewhere ...at a very high price ...! I was a little disappointed ...very mild fragrance ,it was not what I expected for the price ! From now on I will only shop Fragrance net .Always love Givenchy fragrances,was let down by EAU DEMOISELLE DE GIVENCHY!! ",5
4195,"Surprisingly, I found Eau Demoiselle De Givenchy to be a very soft and smooth fragrance. Perfect for a Summer or Spring casual day. I always found Givenchy fragrancecs to be more oriental/spicy or woodsy. ",4
4199,"I'm so glad I bought this, even though I've never smelled it before. It is a GORGEOUS tuberose, but very buttery! One or two sprays will do it. I can smell a tad bit of cinnamon that goes away. A little bit of citrus too, but it is almost just all tuberose so you have to really love it. ",5
4200,Ellen by Ellen Tracy is a very light fresh scent. I love this one! Such a soft and airy scent. ,5
4200,Has strong scent of licorice. It then slightly dies down. ,2
4202,This scent is soft but smells so good.,4
4205, Brittney's perfume never let me down..Kiss kiss. Again I love it!,5
4205,"Love this fragrance, it has that Fantasy smell, but more yummy. There is a slight difference from the others.",4

4209,Fifth avenue style. Just love it. Very fresh. Long lasting.,5
4210,I have used Floris for over twenty years and think highly of all their products.,5
4219,The page shows the old socal perfume but they send the new pink one not mad though since it smells good,5
4226,I purchased the Jadore body milk because I have the purfume and love it. I find that using the scented moisturizer under the perfume gives me a longer lasting scent. I love it.,5
4226,this is so hard to find and at a resonable price i havent seen your price yet and i hope it is not out of this world my wife loves this to death rsp leskan,5
4232,"Joop Summer Ticket eh... NOTHING special at all. Just smells like Joop! So don't let the name ""Summer Ticket"" fool you. Maybe I was looking for something different or unique from the makers of this fragrance..but boy was I wrong. I was going to try some of the other ""flankers"" but I think Im going to pass. Kinda over that whole Joop scent. Try if you must but nothing out of the ordinary. Just false advertisement for ""the Summer""",3
4232,This is a nice cologne with a scent that's not overbearing. Nice size bottle for the price. Will buy again.,4
4236,"This perfume is awesome. I have to wear it EVERYDAY! Everyone wants to know what I am wearing, but a girl has to keep some secrets.",5

4238,"Mature, sexy, intense and intoxicating. It'll work for a date or an evening out with singles intermingling. You may just attract your mate!",5
4239,"Smells kind of like a sharp minty orange herb tea in the opening, or maybe some kind of citrus furniture polish. Dries down to a woody herbal skin scent with slight minty accord in the background. Not sure if I really like it, but it is different, and it actually has gotten a couple of compliments. I think it would be best worn in a more formal setting with suit and tie.",5
4243,"This is classified as a fruity chypre. It has raspberry and bergamot uptop, dries down to a lovely soft patchouli with some powder notes, with some classic Guerlainade supporting everything. Beautiful! Sweet but not sickly sweet. One of my favorites year round; different weather brings out different notes. This can be easily worn anywhere, with any outfit, or to any event, including work.",5
4243,"After reading up on this scent I thought I'd love it. I was wrong. This is, in my opinion, for the more ""mature"" woman (and I'm 58!!). It starts off as startling strong, drying down to a dull roar, then practically disappearing within a few short hours. That was fine with me, as I disliked it immediately. I was going to purchase my Opium, a scent I've loved since I was in my 20s, but figured I'd try something new. I'd return it, but I can't. :(",5
4243,"Simply love this fragrance it is so fresh and light with a touch of flower to it. So many friends compliment me on it and my hubby likes it as well. Many fragrances are harsh and overbearing but Guerlain hit a homerun with this one. There is nothing like it in the market of fragrances, it is truly unique. If you want something with class, light and fresh with just a hint of flower bouquet for that feminine side to you this is your fragrance. I own some pretty expensive fragrances but none of them come close to this one. I'm hooked! ",5
4245,"The name explosive, means explosive; it is definitely not that. It is good enough to wear throughout the day.",3
4259,"This fragrance is awesome, very pleasant and fresh. It definitely reminds of the Habit Rouge edp just amped up. Not a longevity beast but not disappointing either. ",4
4263,"Such elegance in a bottle! Believe me, one spray max on this and you can smell it for 3 weeks, even with showers. Montale Aoud Melody",5
4263,"Awesome fragrance purchase. Great smell, projection, and sillage. Authentic and good price!",5
4266,I absolutely love this Fragrance! Great vanilla and cardamom fragrance especially for Autumn and Winter! Excellent for the price. I'm buying a backup bottle just in case of discontinuation. ,4
4269,This Narciso L Eau for her is very powder smell and not so strong and feel ok wherever you go... but it last only 3 to 4 hours for me...,3
4269,"I love the way this perfume smells, its the first one that does not make me gag. I can't wear a lot of fragrances but this one and Mary Kate & Ashley ""Nirvana White"" are the only ones I can really tolerate. Thanks for the awesome price reduction. Can't beat it...",5
4269,Loved wearing Narcisco Rodriguez L'Eau. The scent mixed well with my chemistry as I received multiple compliments. The scent was soft yet fruity and very clean. Perfect to wear in the office.,5

4274,"Thank you, FragranceNet! I began using Ombre Rose many years ago, and was very disappointed when I could no longer find it ANYWHERE! I am absolutely delighted that it is a cologne/perfume that you carry. I hope you will continue to carry Ombre Rose for a very long time>",5
4274,I have been searching for Ombré Rose for 30 years! My favourite and the longest lasting perfume I have ever come across. Can’t buy the parfum in Australia. Tried to get it in Paris last year but couldn’t. So glad to finally have found a supplier. Ordered and delivered in no time. Thx,5
4274,Ombre Rose When I first started using it way back when I can’t even remember the year. It is been my scent for all of these years when I thought I couldn’t get it again I was very upset so when I found it that you had it I was more than delighted thank you thank you thank you ... I absolutely love Ombré Rose I never want to be without it thank you very much ,5
4274,"I also began wearing Ombre Rose in 1981-2 and anytime I ever wore it, some one would would always ask me what I was wearing that I smelled amazing, it's as good as it gets when it makes you feel beautiful...",5
4274,"Ombré Rose , sensual,sophisticated and a little bit sassy. I love this fragrance and fragrancenet had my order to me in four working days, I live in Australia! Great job guys. ",5
4277,"I am anxious to try the body lotion, however I have also been wearing Paris almost exclusively for at least thirty years. It is perfect as a caregiver as it is not synthesized so blends and is tolerated by those who could be allergic. ",5
4277,"Have worn Paris by Ives St Laurent for several years. It was a gift and I am allergic to many fragrances. This was perfect for me. I have quit with all my other fragrances and use Paris exclusively. Although there are distinct floral tones, I seem to notice a hint of spice. I wear Paris for all occasions. ",5
4277,"Absolutely wonderful fragrance. My coworkers, family knows I am around when I enter the room. I love Paris perfume and the body cream. I have been wearing this for over 30 years and still love it very much.",5
4281,Penhaligons Lilly of the valley is a light but refreshing scent. I absolutely love it and will order the larger size next time,5
4281,I used to plant Lily of the Valley around . Love the smell around the house and it lasted a long time. ,5
4282,"Perry Ellis PL is a very light, clean cologne that I have owned for about 6 months. Staying power is very good, not as good as other PE fragrances (e.g. Perry Ellis new 2008) but good nonetheless. For comparison, think Kenneth Cole Reaction only cleaner and not as sweet. Cannot go wrong with this selection! ",4
4284,Have never had any issues of orders I have placed. Have order plenty at low prices. Love the prices. Just order 4 bottles of PHAT FARM for my boyfriend and gets more complements .,5
4287,Aquolina Shower Gel is the best! I have been using this for years. I get so many comments “You smell great.” Love this stuff!! ,5
4290,Very nice shower gel. Will buy more soon.,4
4290,"Good stuff!! Get it, you won't be let down.",5
4294,Prada La**** i love it lovely fragrance ,5
4295,This Reveal lotion is the perfect combination to truly wear with the perfume. It seems to make the perfume stay fresh longer. I wish all perfumes carried their line to compliment the perfume.,5
4296,This is one of my favourites! Love it along with paradisso and just cavalli. ,5
4297,"Very nice and sensual dark red rose scent, accentuated by patchouli. One of my favorite rose scents so far. ",5
4300,"Very nice. Incense scent, but not too strong. Different from what I usually wear, but very pretty.",4
4303,St Dupont Noir edt has a very pleasant and attracting scent. I get compliments daily. Very affordable and manly.,5
4303,"A remarquable edt, good for business meetings or for dates!! Surely this smell will keep you remembered!!",5
4303,"Picked this up at a duty free shop in Brazil first time, wife loves it and I think it smells good. Decent price for one you can have in your rotation.",5
4311,Tresor La Nuit I liked its spray on citrusy but dries down pleasantly I would purchase again,4
4314,"Omigosh, V is a stunning fragrance!! I'm only familiar with the original but I've never seen this one before. The silage is great & it's got sort of a romantic vibe to it that can also be used for a night out too. Soft, flowery, powdery and versatile is my description for this fragrance and you know, even though Ms. Vanderbilt is gone, I sure am glad I get to discover her creations old and new. Rest easy sweet lady & thank you.",5
4316,Smells beautiful and intoxicating!,5
4316,This is my favorite scent from Valentino. The scent is intense yet subtle. This a scent for a confident woman. ,5
4317,"Juliette Has A Gun - Vengeance Extreme This perfume is dangerous!! It's strong, it's sexy, it's confident and it has attitude. It makes a statement. I wouldn't wear it for the office because it's probably too distracting. Perfect for a night out on the town or date night. This perfume WILL get you noticed and undoubtedly someone will ask you what you're wearing. I wouldn't describe it as either herbal or sweet. It's very 'warm' and sensual, sort of musky and powdery at the same time with notes of roses and chocolate. Strong but not overpowering and doesn't linger in the air like Angel does. One of the sexiest perfumes I have ever worn.",5
4318,I am very pleased with my purchases!! They smell very good and are long lasting,5
4319,Bombshells Nights Is Lovely !!!! Ladies You Will Not B Disappointed ,5

4331,Very good. Long lasting,5
4334,"Just as I anticipated, as I am familiar with this scent. However, Meijer used to carry it for $12, but since they discontinued it, I decided to buy it on here. It cost a bit more to buy it on here, with shipping and whatnot, but at least it was what I was expecting.",5
4338,"Very nice and light scent, lasts about 3 hours. Good for office wear.",4
4338,"Agent Provocateur Pure Aphrodisiaque eau de parfum BY Agent Provocateur Absolutely love this product, as every single one from this collection. Will buy more.",5
4339,"This is a variation on the basic Agua Brava from Puig (Spain/Portugal) which I have liked for many years. Still prefer the original, I think, but this is a nice alternative.",4
4342,the best of the best...,5
4342,"I had to write a review on this fragrance because I love it and compliments all day long. Amouage Memoir man fragrance can make a shy timid person confident and a confident person over the top. As far a seasonal wear, I feel the fragrance should be worn from beginning of fall to the end of winter. The confident person can wear this scent with any attire at any time of day and night and all others should wear classy attire or suit and tie. Throughout the duration of the fragrance it makes you feel a sense of power and control and as far as picking up the ladies....you'll have to see for yourself. Thank you fragrancenet for selling this authentic fragrance, Memoir Man separates itself from the rest.",5
4353,"Extremely under rated !! This is a fragrance that has a warm , inviting move a little closer to me power. Perfect for date night or movie , drink night. Jeans and a shirt or even a wedding soft and unintuitive. Armond Basi Homme , is sophisticated and gentlemanly .",4
4353,"The scent is very similar to Joop, which I don't care for, but this has a better dry-down. Initially I thought I might be sorry I wore this to work, but it softened and stayed somewhat powdery for most of the day. It has a clean, very light musk to the fragrance. ",4
4354,"Armand Basi in Blue Very pleasant clean, citrus, floral scent perfect for the spring and summer. Could be a little longer lasting but then again it is an EdT.",5
4356,"I received the body lotion Aura Mugler by Thierry Mugler today Apr 23/19 and i'm super exited,i'm absolutely in love with their products,the smell it's fantastic and last for 24 h,delivery was fast and the seller very nice,send it to me gift also,excellent service!!!

4356,"I absolutely love Thierry Mugler products I've been using them for years. I ordered the shower gel, the body lotion to add to the perfume. It smells beautiful a little strong when you first put it on but then it settles down & smells great. It lasts all day as do all of Thierry muglers perfumes lotions.",5
4357,"Bought it right before Valentine's Day. I am very, very pleased with the quality of this fragrance. I have compliments from my colleagues at work and in church. Just an exellent, elegant type fragrance. Buy it now....",5
4358,Azzaro Pour Homme L'eau garners so many compliments its crazy ...They highly esteem it on fragrantica and compare it to Rive Gauche ...Whats not to like and for 17 dollars do yourself a favor don't be a greedy Grady and get yourself a bottle ,4
4358,"Smells very synthetic and cheap, almost like cheap fruity liquor............YUCK!",1
4358,Azzaro pour homme l'eau. Common generic smell very good for the price...,3
4358,"Very pleasant, lemon-aqua scent.",5
4360,Love this product. Easy to use and lasts for a long time. I will be purchasing more.,5
4362,"Black XS Potion (for Men) Execellent , like the berries on top of the woods, I wear it everywhere. I hope it will be available in Canada so I don't have to keep ordering it.",5
4362," I have used several colognes from Paco Rabanne in the past and ""Potion"" has been the latest that I have tried. Potion is a very long lasting cologne and I have received many complements on this scent in the last few weeks that I have been wearing it. I hope that Paco Rabanne continues to make Potion available in the future!",5
4363,"Bond No.9 Broadway Nite smells like a modern, edgy Chanel No.5. It's powdery aldehyde is better for a mature lady but like the other reviewer stated, it is not matronly. It smells very expensive because it is but don't let the price keep you away. It is very economical as you only have to wear a dab, it really projects and lasts well into the next day. It's a unique scent, best for a mature woman that loves Chanel No.5 but is feeling a little dangerous.",5
4363,"This is for Broadway Nite EDP. FABULOUS. Sweet, but only a bit, I first think I smelled the iris and then the rest. I really like this and hope there are others that are as big and smell as wonderfully mature without smelling matronly as this manages to be.",5
4364,"Little Italy, is a Beautiful, Refreshing Scent! I purchased this fragrance strictly from the notes, it does not disappoint! Love it!!",5
4366,"I really like and enjoy the smell of Bond No.9 Shelter Island! In my humble opinion it is a excellent, refreshing Spring and Summer time fragrance, I also believe that it is a fragrance that could be worn you around/all four seasons.",5
4366,"By far the weakest Bond I own. The top notes disappear quickly, followed by a the mids which disappear so close to the skin no one else can smell it. If I want to see how it's doing I have to rub it in with my hand and even then there's no projection. Nice scent, extremely disappointed in Bond with this one due to it's failed longevity and sillage.",5
4376,"NICEEEEEEEEEEEE, SMELL LASTTTTTTTTTTTT AND FEELS NICE",5
4376,Love it smells good ,5
4383,If it’s not Chanel then you need to try it cause it smells sooooo good. ,5

4385,I like unforgettable vary much . I use to wear it years ago when I was a young girl and always got compliments on it but then they stop selling it. so I haven’t had it for a long while until now when I found it on line . I love it and it is a nice Pleasant smell not to strong . I just had a couple of compliments on it the other day . The lady that ask about it I told her where I got it and she is going to check out the sit . Thank you for having it. ,5
4385,"My daughter received this as a birthday gift & I couldn't help myself to a spritz, considering I am a perfume fanatic. I was really impressed with this scent by Christina. It is a very cosy, warm scent that has a beautiful dry down. I rate this perfume 4/5 as I love the slight powdery finish to this fragrance.",4
4388,I love the original Cool Water fragrance so I decided to try this one. Sensual Essence is a cute and soft fragrance. It isn't very strong but cute enough for someone to ask what you're wearing. I would recommend you wear this during the day. ,3
4394,"Very nice package, great value.",4
4395,First time having this perfume & I love it ,5
4395,"i love this, i start buying 8 years ago a pefume. they have discontinued in store and I can't find it at no stores. this is the best thing that ever bought. I really love this stuff... I don't want to use anything else. Just found out about this web site from a friend. and when i typed in the name i got it .... Happy customer..",5
4397,Dkny Be Delicious Crystallized smells great! It smells like fresh and crisp apples,5
4403,Eau De Charlotte is my new favorite fragrance. I would like to have the perfume so the scent lasts longer. You always seem to be out of it. It's not like any other fragrance I've ever used.,5
4403,"Eau de Charlotte by Annick Goutal reminds me of a Sonnet;very lyrical in nature. It is a light, citrus scent, with a fruity effervescence. It's very esoteric. The fragrance can take you from morning to evening. And there is none other like it. Enjoy!",5
4403,"This is a wonderful perfume for the daytime. I would recommend it for work or weekends. It has a soft, feminine scent that is great for any age.",3
4406,"I just started wearing ENDLESS by Sarah Jessica Parker and this may be my most favorite by far. Thanks to FragranceNet, I can purchase a beauty at a reasonable price! People always comment on my perfumes, but this one has turned more mens heads than any of the others I wear. It's very LOVELY! ",3
4408,"Envy Me shower gel and the perfume are amazing If you want to feel more sexy seductive fresh clean all day I recommend this for everyone of all ages is amazing. I get alot of compliments when u first spray it is strong but as the day goes by is soft, Enjoy! ",5
4408,I have compliments every time I wear this fragrance. I love it. I would rate it the best!,5
4411,I started wearing this fragrance when my previous favourite Ted Lapidus was discontinued when I was in my mid 20s. It feels to me like I am in an orange grove when I first put it on but it balances out into a beautiful balance of scents. I always got asked what I was wearing & still do today. One of my all time favourites!,5
4412,NEVER USED FATHOM COLOGNE BEFORE BUT I WILL SURE USE IT AGAIN.,5
4417,"Fujiyama Elegantissimo was a blind buy for me and I was pleasantly surprised. The fragrance is fresh and citrusy and woody. The scent lasts about four hours, but for the price, it's definitely worth purchasing as an every day casual fragrance. ",5
4419,"Gap Deep is a cologne you really must like because it’s smell won’t get noticed unless you are close to some one. At first I was like i don’t smell anything, but after a while I noticed the fresh citrusy smell it was quite pleasent. If it was a bit stronger it would be a really good buy.",3
4419,"Gap Deep is a great, fresh and clean scent for casual wear. I have received a lot of compliments while wearing this scent. Its last all day on my skin and projects very well for 3-4 hours. I would recommend this scent to anyone wanting a great casual wear scent for a great price",5
4422,I brought it for my mom for mother’s days and she loved it. She already had the scent but she went to Macy’s and it was way more than what I paid on here and she didn’t even get the gift set. I will definitely be ordering from here all the Time,5

4425,"Now this is a pleasurable fragrance that draws you into the scent of something bizarre, but beautiful. I'm very pleased with my product. Thank you.",5
4425,"Halloween Freesia is a light, very clean, watery floral that's ideal for any age, anytime. I ADORE IT. If angels wear perfume, this is it. I'm fussy about florals, and there's nothing piercing or sharp here, I'm not blasted with a typical "" multi-flower bouquet"" note, which I'm not all that fond of, as this is a single mildly scented flower. It's truly divine! This is my second bottle, a tester, which came with the cap and a sealed box...which is unusual for a tester, but I'm not complaining by any means.",5
4433,"Jaguar Classic Motion-This scent is fresh, clean and crisp. The combination of a citrus and pepper give it a presence not unlike patchouli, but nowhere near as strong. There is a lavender floral note, but not too much, as to make it effeminate. The Jaguar scents have their own character that sets them apart. Classic motion has good staying power for the whole workday. ",5
4433,Jaguar Classic Motion is some of the best Mens cologne that I have used I swear by it. I use it about Everyday always being told by women how good it smells and had the Men Folk to ask Me what I was wearing till I find something better it will always be in My house! ,5
4434,PATOU 1000: BLACK VIOLETS AND ROSE KENNEDY !! TIMELESS !,5
4434,"1000- I cant say enough about this perfume. I first found it in 1990's and rarely use anything else. It never ever disappoints me. I can wear it anytime anywhere and it always fits. I find new scents but I never tire of 1000. Nothing will ever take its place. It becomes harder and harder to find and buy. Please, never stop producing it. I will always buy my special perfume. ",5
4437,"I just used up my first bottle of Jessica Simpson Ten. Really like it. A lovely fruity-floral, more ""grown up"" and mature an the rest of her perfumes. There's a tart green starfruit note in this one I found refreshing. Lovely bottle too. Bought another bottle.",5
4438,I absolutely love Jimmy Choo's fragrances but there's something so special about Jimmy Choo Flash London it's more rustic and it's not as sweet smelling like the Jimmy Choo Flash... I love them both.. I would definitely recommend buying this one and it's long lasting on the body and clothes..,5
4438,My daughter and I love this fragrance.,5
4438,"I love this fragrance so much that when I ran out I ordered another bottle. I received so many compliments when people would always ask me what I am wearing. They would asked for name and designer of fragrance. I have told so many people the name Flash London Club by designer Jimmy Choo, I should receive a royalty check, lol. Serious it is a wonderful fragrance. I will never allow myself to run out again as long as they continue to produce this lovely fragrance. ",5
4438,"Flash, London club does not last, has no great smell.",2
4438,I love this fragrance! ,5
4445,"I have about 150 different perfumes and Kelly Caleche is one of my top 10 choices of perfumes. I used this on romantic evenings, showing off or impressing people. It's an absolute head turner, sexy and the fresh scents linger around the room. Women should try and experience to be admired and be remembered. It will make a statement and it will be your signature. Amazing scent!",5
4445,"this perfume is excellent, ",5
4450,Very nice and long lasting. Good price.,5
4453,L'Artisan Parfumeur Safran Troublant edt is a great scent. Love the saffron. Very different. Not overpowering at all. ,4
4456,"Been using Lapidus Woman for about 5 plus years. I don't use it everyday, but the scent is great for me and not overbearing. I bought some samples to find out if anyone liked the scent and I remembered and passed on as gifts",5
4460,LOEWE POUR HOMME My husband has been using this lotion for several years. I love it! It really makes him smell different! Everywhere he goes people know he has arrived... they recognize him by the way he smells . ,5

4475,I love using Marina De Bourbon Reverence during the day and night. I always get lots of compliments when I use it. A little bit goes a long way!,5
4476,I like to wear this fragrance to the office or on interviews. It IS refreshing and exhilarating yet POWERFUL AND IN CHARGE. A wonderful scent.,5
4476,Marina De Bourbon Rouge Royal is a very soft perfume..very nice and romantic..,4
4483,"Mon Guerlain lotion is so silly and soft. The scent of the first touch on my skin was like warm amber, sandalwood, and fresh air. I felt sensuous wearing Mon Guerlain and will be ordering more before I run out, that is, if my source does not run out.",5

4497,"This Nilang by Lalique is a beautiful, long lasting, fresh spring/summer perfume. Watery, ozonic with great longevity and moderate projection. A great value and hidden gem. This opens my eyes into the collection of Lalique. I will definitely be getting more.",5
4501,"This fragrance smells so good, I have to keep my daughters away from it, ages 24 & 34 lol. This frangrace lasts all day and you will smell wonderful, try it! You will not be disappointed.",5
4512,This is my favorite cologne. I have always purchase Pierre Cardin's colognes. Scent is not strong. My wife loves the smell of them. Best of all reasonably priced for a great product!,5
4515,the recent purchase of Polo Big Pony #1 perfume has left me great satisfaction. has a pleasant and soft fragrance. Thank you,5
4515,this product (polo big pony #1) smells like candy at first once you put it on example similer to sweet tarts and a hint of sweet flowers. then as it wheres off it starts to more flowery and sweet. it would fit teens to collage students 12-24 years of age on a casual setting anytime anywhere,5
4515,Ralph Lauren Polo Big Pony 1 is a very pleasant and fresh fragrance.,5

4516,"SMELL IS GOOD, OTHER PEOPLE SAY I SMELL GOOD....",5
4516,Polo supreme leather. Polo nice love it,5
4516,"Purchased Polo Supreme Leather. It’s a fragrance best suited for winter, but if you’re looking for a fragrance that smells like leather in the way of Tom Ford Tuscan Leather, this isn’t the fragrance. This considerably softer & sweeter. It’s still a “spicy” fragrance that is best suited for fall/winter. It just arguably doesn’t smell like leather. In my opinion it’s similar to a D&G The One or even an older Vera Wang fragrance. Smells great—",3
4516,My international lady friends go crazy over this. Cardamom is very popular overseas. I ALWAYS get at least one compliment an evening while I'm wearing it. Wonder who was too timid to tell me.,5
4519,I love the scent of Britney Spears Radiance !!!!,5
4519,"Was my first purchase with any Britney Spears scents, and it will be my last. It was too ""young"" for me and the scent didnt last very long. It had bubble gum or cotton candy notes that just didnt agree with me. That was my overall disappointment with Radiance. The bottle is very pretty, but I was hoping this would last throughout the day and it did not. If you like the young, subtle, and sweet cotton candy kind of stuff, then this is for you. ",2
4519,My first purchase of any Britney Spears fragrance..Radiance being the type I bought. I'm so in love with this scent!! Buy the big tester for economical reasons plus the bottle is beautiful!,5
4519,Light long lasting scent. Gorgeous bottle. What's not to like ?,5
4519,A very light happy scent. The scent lasted longer than I would have thought. Pleasant surprise! ! Beautiful bottle gets noticed on a vanity. Happy scent truly is a mood elevator.,5
4520,My husband and I love this scent. I will purchase again.,5
4522,"Great smell, very elegant package, I love it",5

4533,"I've been a long time fan (over 40 years) of Shalimar, and decided to try Shalimar Souffle de Parfum. And I'm so happy that I did. It's a deeper, more intense fragrance, but still not heavy or overpowering. If you're hesitating about the purchase, I urge you to give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",5
4535,not really thrilled. the scent does not last. I am still not sure how to rate the perfume. My go to was Avience Night Musk. Maybe someone could help me find a scent that is a sister scent to the Night Musk.,5
4538,Justin Bieber someday is amazing and I love it,5
4538,I ordered 4 different fragrances all of them where in there original bottle and packaging and price was great compared to what I pay in the department stores was very happy with everything I ordered and received it in the mail in only a few days from ordering.,5

4538,"I love Someday by JB, I wear it everyday to school and work and people always seem to like it.",5
4547,"Tory Burch Absolu is a beautiful spring / summer fragrance that is universally appealing - inoffensive . It is for the “conservative” yet “ “elegant” lady who works in a professional environment and doesn’t want to offend anyone . She’s a “boss” who’s cool, calm and collected —— the only woman in the boardroom !!! She’s strikingly beautiful as well as unmistakably intelligent !!! She knows her worth ..... ",4

4572,"Acqua Colonia Lime & Nutmeg is delicious! Lime is one of my favourite notes in perfumes. especially when the weather is hot and/or humid. I even spray some on a piece of paper and tape the paper to the air conditioner so when the air blows the room gets the lovely scent. It has become my go to perfume when I want to feel refreshed, clean and pretty. ",5
4576,My son's favorites are Acqua di Parma products. My daughter-in-law would only purchase these items through major department stores feeling that doing otherwise might result in substitutions. I bought through your company and my son was delighted. It was the product he wanted but at far less cost to me. I will purchase these items from you in the future from now on. I have purchased my own perfumes from you in the past without disappointment. ,5
4578,This is my husbands favourite after shave. I used to buy this for $7 here in Canada and now can't get it anymore. thankful I found this site because every other sight is $70 or more for one. I will be ordering a few more soon,5
4587,I love Amouage Dia. I first started using this perfume when my husband brought a bottle home for me after a business trip. I was delighted to find it on fragrancenet when I started to run low! I am often complimented on the scent by both men and women. I am very sensitive to heavy perfumes but this one is lighter and my go-to choice at all times. ,5
4587,"Dia by Amouage is a beautiful fragrance that really lasts through the day. It's a heavy floral, like Jean Patou's Joy, but with a very prominent rose scent. It does not feature the fruity qualities of many modern fragrances. If you want a romantic, sophisticated floral, this is the one!",5
4587,"I bought the Amourage Dia, and I love the fragrance. It's stronger going on but then settles into a really gentle one after an hour. I put it on after showering and I've found it clings to my clothes, so it's actually staying much longer around sleeves and neck than I can dertemine on my arms. It's a gorgeous frangrance, it's my new go to. For reference I like to wear Elizabeth Taylor's Passion.",5
4587,"love the clean fresh scent of DIA,the secret is layering it with dia body lotion!!!!",4
4588,It has a nice fragrance and last all day. ,5
4588,best cologne ever!!! Amouage Library Opus Vii is the best from Amouage ,5
4589,Pure leather is another mugler bomb longevity is awesome very good blend of notes to me kinda a little bit of a mint blast is present but that might just be me overall great scent ,5
4589,angel leather is a great scent. The Ladies love it.,5
4589,"It only let me pick one of each description and it needs more than one. Angel Men Pure Leather is the most incredible cologne, it is a true masterpiece regardless if you like the smell itself. It may not suit everyone but this cologne performs amazingly, it improves with drydown but it's very linear at the same time, it doesn't get thin and sour smelling like many do after 6-8 hrs, but it smells so good right off the hop you just want to keep refreshing the spray every few hours. Out of the notes listed on fragrancenet I do not smell any but the leather, and the leather is nicely snuggled in with this incredibly rich and complex caramel chocolate patchouli fusion, and it's so well balanced you can't decide which smell is the dominant one. I even catch a bit of mint in the first hour of wear, I am really impressed with this cologne and the ladies absolutely melt. You will smell like a mysterious yet comfortable guy with a manly leather hint and an intoxicating sweetness that makes them want to unwrap you and put you in their mouth. :-) The price went up like $20 since I ordered it from here last month but now that I've worn it I would gladly pay full retail if I had to get more. Smells a bit like CK Dark Obsession but several points better and with the leather in the background to man it up to lumberjack status. Highly recommended for evening, romantic, clubbing, dinner, basically everything except summer days and business meetings. I'm 31 and so far in the last two weeks of wearing Amen Pure Leather I've gotten compliments from women ages 19-41",5
4589,"Unless you like tobacco or leather scent, otherwise this is NOT for you. I usually wear colognes from moderate to strong level of scents but this one is way too powerful for me. In fact, I had to take a shower to wash it off shortly after I had it on. The scent is very different from anything I have tried. It is almost too overpowering.",5
4589,If you like the leather scent this is for you and a good price too ,5
4606,"Of the Bogart Story Collection, the Blue has to be my favorite by far. Has an outstanding long lasting masculine fragrance that lasts all day. Receive compliments every single time I wear it. Would recommend this item for yourself or for a gift. Believe most men would appreciate this wonderful Bogart fragrance for the price offered.",5
4607,"Bois 1920 - notturno fiorentino eau de parfum spray 3.4 oz Tester Warm, sensuous aroma that lasts! I've been searching for a scent like this for ages. I wish there were more sizes available, as well as body lotion or cream. ",5
4610,This was my first time ordering this fragrance body cream! Disappointed! The smell doesn't last!,1
4612,my wife loves it uuuuuuh aaah.,5
4624,"I ordered Clive Christian X and received it very quickly! I had zero issues with receiving it, and they even included goodies in the box. Great overall experience, looking to do more business in the future with FragranceNet.",5
4624,So what if I skipped a mortgage payment to pay for a wonderful bottle of Clive Christian X to present to my girlfriend the scent is fabulous. Clive Christian X is worth every penny. Your lady will be turning heads when she walks by if she wears Clive Christian. Very good perfume. ,5
4626,"I really have to wonder if I was sent the same thing the other reviewers. Comptoir Sud Pacifique Matin Calin is okay. It doesn't smell bad, just not that great either - unless you like to smell like buttered popcorn. I have had multiple people blind sniff this and this is the consensus. There is no milky creamy note, no note of sweetness or sugar, just salty butter and a air popped corn. It is very light and doesn't last very long as others noted. I am mixing it with other perfumes to get something more wearable. Great to wear if you are looking to recreate a movie theatre experience at home. I will use it, but I will not be repurchasing.",3
4626,Matin Calin is SO Addictive! Smells just like warm milk and sugar cookies! So comforting and delicious! I cannot sleep without it ~ I also spray on my sheets and pillow. I order 2-3 bottles at a time. I NEVER want to be without it! EVER!! I just ordered Chabaud's Lait de Creme and Lait de Biscuit. As they are the same notes as CSP Matin Calin but the cost of Chabaud is about 3 x more than CSP. I will do a review on those when I receive them. Chabaud is extremely hard to find in the U.S. Had to order from France. But I will never give up my CSP Matin Calin!! Highly recommend!! If you're on the fence JUMP! You won't regret it! YUMMMMMMY!!,5
4626,"Matin Calin smells so yummy! It smells like warm milk and fresh baked cookies. It doesn't last super long. That is OK for me as I have no desire to wear this during the day. For me it feels like a good scent to wear while curled up on the couch with a good book or movie. For anyone that likes to wear a scent to bed at night this might be a grea one for that as well, as long as you're not hungry. It might make you crave milk and cookies.",4
4626,"This smells like warm creamy milk, hot out the oven expensive vanilla cookies. It's so comforting. Its definitely a gourmand. I'll be buying a bigger bottle very soon I'm so glad I took a chance on it.",5
4626,"This fragrance was discontinued for a while and now it's back! made me so happy. It's not something you'd want to wear to work: steamy sweet sugared milk with semolina and vanilla, dulce de leche, perfectly gourmand, one of the most comforting smells I know. I buy it to wear at home and at night if I just need a good night's sleep.",5
4627,Blanc courreges give it a try . You won’t be disappointed i swear ,5
4627,Oh my gosh ! Blanc Courreges i will buy it again for sure ,5

4638,This new DY scent is amazing! Very light and clean. The first day I wore it I received many compliments!,5
4638,"4 stars. Awesome smell. Goes on like flower perfume. On me it turns into a musky beautiful scent with just a hint of flowers. I love it. 4 stars because you have to reapply. Does not last all day. For this price, will buy again.",4
4638,I recently bought David Yurman Summer Essence. I had no idea what I was buying but I had previously purchased the DY Exotic Essence (which I love) I thought I would give Summer Essence a try. The description of it read as something I would like. It is very light on me and I like to reapply it to keep the fragrance fresh. I like the presentation of the bottle also it is classic clean lines. ,4
4638,Love it. Best ever,4
4638,Summer essence is a light floral / fruity essence... I work with the public so I try not to have heavy scents on ..Summer is all about light fun scents ....This is my 2nd or 3rd bottle of this scent.. I also have several other scents by him..I like his products very much ..,5
4640,"Loverdose is sinfully delightful. I got it from a guy who had a crush on me since high school and he remembered my birthday so this was a sweet gift. He thought I wouldn't like it but I did,and believe it or not,this was supposed to be a gift to his now ex who treated him like dirt. Oh well, her loss, my gain!! ",5
4640,"Woooooow,this perfume is one hell of a shocker here!! Ladies,you have got to try loverdose for all your evening & romantic occasions. I agree it can be used as a fall/winter scent too,however my take on it is different. I think it can be compared to my other favorites,Dior's poison or Cabotine. ",5
4640,"Wooooooow,where was this delicious fragrance hiding all this time?! Loverdose is quite an unusual name for it & I,too,love the bottle design. I could kick myself for not discovering this one sooner,but I won't because that would hurt. Anyways,it's everything you'll ever want in a fragrance,smooth,long-lasting and just downright sexy,no lie. Buy some for yourself today. ",5
4640,"Aw man, this perfume is b-e-a-utifullll!!! Loverdose by Diesel is the kind of scent that people will notice and if I could compare it to any other fragrance,it would be a toss up between OP blend and/or Miss Dior. So if you want something sweet, sexy and long lasting,try this fragrance. I guarantee you'll love it just like I do. ",5
4640,"Loverdose is a very unusual scent and you either love it or hate it, but I love it. It's definitely a winter scent in my opinion. If you don't like anise or licorice then you won't like this scent. Personally I think it's an amazing combination of notes. It's very similar to Lolita Lempicka but stronger. I don't wear this every day but when I do I love how the scent just lingers on my clothing and my hair since I spray it all over. It lasts quite a while but I take the beautiful bottle to work with me anyway. I actually have the eau de parfume , but I would imagine the scent is the same just probably doesn't last as strong. Whichever way you decide to with this scent, I think it's awesome.",5
4643,Elie Saab Essence No. 6 Vetiver is not a scent for me. I tried it based on the customer reviews about it but I was disappointed.,1

4646,"I received a sample of Equipage in Paris and loved it. I have purchased it several time since then, usually overseas. My wife loves it and encourages me to wear it. ",5
4655,"There are definitely better citrus fragrances on the market. I gave this three stars (out of a possible five), only because I’m not a fan of citrus fragrances. Plus this smells like many other citrus's on the market today. Mass-appealing for sure. This is great juice for a younger guy for clubbing. If I was a younger guy this would get five stars. Great projection and longevity too. This house needs to get more attention. Next I’m trying out Franck Olivier's Oud Vanille.",2
4656,The smell doesn’t last long.,2
4657,"Fujiyama Black Label , Unfortunately is another pass for me, not recommended via Blind buy.",2

4661, i love the smell of this perfume and it smell similar to gucci flora. the smell is not overpowering and floral not sweet. to make it last longer take a hot shower then spray,5
4661,Very nice scent whenever I wear it I get lots of compliments ,4
4664,"I purchased both the Gucci Oud and Valentino Oud. I prefer this over the Valentino although they are both wonderful scents. The Gucci blends the Oud more beautifully. It is noticeable but not in your face. This perfume takes the Gucci by Gucci up to another level and I love this scent. This was a blind buy and I did well, Thank GOD. I do recommend it if you like Gucci by Gucci and enjoy the scent of Oud. Good marriage.",5
4667,"I had never heard of any of the Halloween perfumes until I saw them on this website. It's my favorite holiday and I thought the bottle/box are pretty, so I decided to try the mini Halloween Kiss and I'm very happy with it. The scent is unique and interesting but if I had to compare it to something, it reminds me of Victoria's Secret Amber Romance but better and spicier. I plan to buy the 3.4 ounce bottle.",5
4676,The scent would last....... for like 10 mins then its gone forever You would hav to reapply every 10 mins if you bought this cologne Not recommend it. ,1

4702,Luna Blossom by Nina Riccin is a sweet subtle fragrance which will not irritate you but slowly linger around you. Very convenient fragrance for office and shopping. ,3
4707,"One word ""yummy"" - its gourmand fragrance but not a sweet one. So simple if you like eating box of milk chocolate next to a bouquet of Velvety Red Roses... like on Valentine's Day or any Special occasion. Then Mancera Roses & Chocolate is for you. Mancera is famous for a beastmode parfumer, one or 2 sprays are so enough to last 12hours or more. This perfume projects and linger so talking about sillage is top 10. The only downside of Mancera, its not major - its the cap that you need to twist, if you twist a little harder you will twist the sprayer or atomizer off the bottle. So becareful with Mancera bottle. ",5
4712,Excellent body wash. Michael Jordan Balance,5
4716,"Never fail!! I love this so much. The scent is rich and unique!! This is great Mugler piece. If you love all of the Mugler collection, you will adore this!! Notes are bulgarian rose, bergamot and bourbon pepper; middle notes are nutmeg, heliotrope and agarwood (oud); base notes are patchouli, cedar and guaiac wood. ",5
4716,"I absolutely love Angel, Alien and Aura. I ordered this because of the brand. I’m not sure if I like it or not. It is a very unique scent, it just seems a bit heavy. I’m going to stick with it and use it for a few days. Maybe I will like it better. ",3
4717,"I love the scent of Modern Muse Eau De Rouge. I thought that the smell didn’t last but went to a store and a lady was walking by and asked another lady about the smell. That what she was wearing and she said nothing but turned out it was me, the perfume of Estée Lauder Modern Muse Eau De Rouge. She kept saying that who ever it was that it smelled very good. I love, love this scent. Anything from Estée Lauder, you will not be disappointed. ",5
4719,"Montale Aoud Leather great and strong performer, smells very good long lasting will purchase again and will recommend also.",5
4721,Very woodsy. The initial blast in filled with Vetiver and then it transforms into a woodsy and spices scent. Every now and then the vetiver rises. I compared to Tom Ford's Vetiver and this one is much more complex.,5
4721,Nice mild fragrance that last most of the day.,4
4723,"I love Mugler! Angel is my favorite (Star), and I also was really impressed with Alien and also Muse. Apparently I love the exotic layered stronger scents... I did not love this particular fragrance and am slightly disappointed. It is airy & light. Does not have the staying power of Angel or Alien. Will not buy again. Was not worth the price to try. Should've saved up for my Mugler favorites instead. Not a bad smell-just rather ordinary for Mugler House. js. <3 MUGLER anyway/always!",3
4727,"This is actually a nice scent. Its not citrus solely, but has a spicy touch. Is it my favorite? No. But it is quite pleasant. It isn't a regrettable buy.",3
4734,Oui is a hard to find item It is not sold in stores. The product smells exactly as expected.. I love it!,5
4734,"A little stronger than I'm used to, but I will have to try it when I am not in a rush and just spray some on my wrist and see how it works with my body chemistry.....",5
4734,I have been wearing Oui for the past 10 years & when the stores discontinued selling this fragrance I immediately ordered from my favorite perfume/cologne site.,5
4734,I have been wearing this fragrance since 1997. I always receive compliments. A Lancôme representative even stopped me in a store to ask me what fragrance I was wearing. I told her she should know. She has no idea. She said she never smelled it on someone. She wished Lacome hasn't stopped selling it. I referred her to this website.,5
4735,The Paco Robanne Cologne offers a satisfying fragrance that arrouses the senses with subtle gestures.,5
4737,"I love this smell, it is so dainty and soft. Everyone wants to know what it is and you will hear how good you smell for as long it lasts. keep it handy for it scent starts to wear down after 3 to 4 hours. Love it. ",5
4737,"Parfume D'OR is seductive. It's not sweet. It's not flowery. In fact it is more of a dry fragrance. I certainly would not classify it as crisp. A which makes me feel very confident. This is the first time that I have ever used it. How that ever happened is beyond me. Do not know how this missed my radar. But so glad that I at long last discovered it. Makes me want to put on silk undergarments, tailored slacks, silk blouse that moves with a breeze, a pair of heels and do .......anything. Helen Reddy singing 'I am Woman"" would be good too. This scent is absolutely magnificent and I would wear this anywhere with the exception of black tie...and really....how many of us have many black tie events. I can't stop raising my wrist to my nose.......it's intoxicating, unexpected and wonderful",5
4741,"For the past 35 years I have used 1000 Eau de Perfume by Jean Patou, I just love it, but I could not find it anywhere. I decide to try a new fragrance for the first time, PATOU FOREVER and I loved it. It is flowery, sweet, and fruity. I fell in love with it!! I used it alone and in combination with the 1000, and it set to last all day and night. Now, I can not find it. Please let me know when you get it again!!!!",5
4742,"Luv the smell, one of my favorite""s!",5
4744,"Don't let the ""fruits"" in the fragrance description throw you off - this is a beautiful fragrance I would label as ""traditionally luxurious."" It's smooth and rich upon dry-down where the bergamot is soft - not fruity or flowery. I really love it. However, it has disappointingly little staying power and disappears after an hour or so on my skin. This is unfortunate as not only is this scent difficult to ""test"" unless you're in London, it's pricey - especially for a fragrance that vanishes quickly. Penhaligon's creates such complex fragrances that offer unique options - dry down is vital with this perfumier - I just wish the products had more longevity.",2
4749,Philosophy Loveswept.... Thank you. Very pleased..,5
4753,"Antonio Banderas Power of Seduction is actually a decent performer. Semi-sweet but fresh, fruity and citrusy. Great for the upcoming summer weather. And a bargain for the performance.",4

4757,"I get complemented every time I wear this fragrance, I love how fresh it is.",5
4759,"Roberto Cavalli does it again! This is a gorgeous masculine fragrance for men. Floral and aromatic opening. On the dry down this fragrance comes alive with cardamom, sweet tonka and spice. The orris root does give this a bit of a starchy backdrop, but nothing unbearable at all; and lends to the soft warm spicy freshness. I actually prefer this fragrance over Roberto Cavalli Uomo. This fragrance could be warn all year round. Special evening events or date nights. I really enjoy this floral, warm and spicy vibe! I'm glad I picked this one up!",5
4763,"Salvador Dali is my all time favorite and only perfume and has been for over 30 years. Every single time I wear this someone comments on how good I smell, I've had strangers tell me while standing in line. This is a very strong perfume on me when I first apply but as it wears off it just gets better and better and after a few hours I just love it. I suppose this is considered a ""formal"" scent like for a night out but I wear it every single day just because I love it. I have to be careful as a little goes a long way. This is very hard to find and am just thrilled that Fragrance Net has it. Can't praise this enough and the bottle is beyond incredible too. Men love this perfume. Would rate it a 20 if I could.",5

4965,"I stumbled upon Insolence Eau Glacier at the Guerlain store at EPCOT in 2009 & was instantly hooked. It's light, sexy, confident, and most definitely icy. Smells like nothing I've ever come across. The green apple topnote is not 'in-your-face' but subtle and just mmmm. I also somehow get a hint of tea in the scent. Originally intended to be a limited-release fragrance, I think those of us who love it protested so much that it's now part of Guerlain's lineup! Wearing it makes you feel happy, confident, and beautiful. Not a yippee vanilla youthful scent nor a flowery old lady scent, I recommend it for women 35-65. Doesn't last as long as I'd like but I love the opportunity to spritz all over again!!",4
4968,"Island fantasy smells very nice. I honestly did not think I would like it but I do. Some of her other fragrances are either too candy-ish or sugary sweet & after a while,I couldn't stand them anymore. This one is more my speed. A nice combo of the tropics and citrus. Well done,Britney. ",5
4969,"Love this fragrance--it's light, & flowery but not over powering--my new fav fragrance--I also love estee lauders pleasure, Hippy Chic, & Marc Jacobs collections",5

4992,"L'Artisan Parfumeur's Dzing is intensely sweet at first, but that peels away to reveal something dirtier and animalic. The dry-down on this fragrance verges on being offensive, but is kept from going south by some comforting and familiar accords. Coming to the rescue are notes of caramel, vanilla and hay that gently disguise the leathery musk that really sticks with you long after the initial candy/macaroon top notes wear off. This performs like an EDP. This fragrance is certainly for those that are a little more daring, and definitely not a blind buy. I would say this is a more mature fragrance that leans towards the feminine side, although a certain gentleman can also pull it off. In short, this is a musky-gourmand that demands a second or even a third try before a verdict can be reached. ",4
4993,"Noir Exquis indeed! This is lovely and sooo unique. Earthy,nutty,slightly gourmand! Love it! Unisex!",5
4993,"Delish! Strong, long lasting, and memorable. ",5

5017,love it. sweet fragancy sexy smell. my favorite,5
5017,Ma Griffe has been one of my favorites since I found it in Paris when I was a flight attendent for Pan Am. I received many complements as to the pleasant scent I was wearing and how it was not over powering on board the air plane on long flights. I am now 81 years old and the scent takes me back to those wondersul days.,5

5028,Exactly what I ordered ,5
5028,Mauboussin Elixir Pour Elle - awesome eau de parfum with moderate silage and good longevity 4-6 hours for me. A very pretty scent reminding me of La Vie but at a fraction of the price. Check out the online reviews as this scent has great ratings and can be purchased for a fantastic price. ,5
5030,"Mauboussin Pour Elle The first whiff was a strong blast of a fruity, peppery rose, floral mix. Feminine floral though I am still trying to find the rose part. Top notes are rhubarb, red fruits and orange blossom. The scent does last several hours....good for daytime. ",4
5030,Mauboussin Rose Pour Elle -- I've been trying out different Rose scents in addition to Chloe Roses (a love). In my opinion this fragrance holds its own. Sweeter and perhaps not as sour or with as much depth as Chloe it is a very pretty rose fragrance with moderate silage and longevity. A delightful find at a fantastic price. ,5
5031,memo-paris-french-leather eau-de-parfum is a very clean lite citrus scent that isn’t over powering and lasts all day. This is my second bottle and it has become my favorite parfum to wear. Give it a try I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.,5
5034,"Midnight Oud is a fragrance that has to be experienced. I can tell you how FABULOUS it smells, and that it is one of the nicest Oud's i have. I recommend applying about 1/2 hr before you go out. Although I do not think it is a strong scent, when it dries down a bit it is even more fabulous. How nice ? I was a a car dealership and when I left, a woman came running after me to ask what perfume I was wearing. Same at the office; when I pass by fellow employees I am frequently told how nice a ""wake"" I leave. Buy it - you'll love it !!! Oh, added bonus, the packaging is also beautiful and one bottle will last you quite a while.",5
5036,"Very solid iris fragrance. Works well layers over chocolaty gourmand's to create an intense long lasting, and, addictive scent. ",5
5036,Molinard Violette. A slightly green sweet floral violet. A perfect perfume for spring and summer,4

5044,"montale wood & spice, I love it. You had sent me a sample awhile back, never forgot it. I finally ordered it. thanks again. Oscar O. Lima",5
5045,"First, I bought the Montana Homme with the blue box. This is a nice clean, soapy scent. Initially, it's slightly floral perhaps with a touch of spice. After a couple hours, I start picking up a little more of the oakmoss. This will work very nicely in warmer weather. For the price, this was a quality purchase. ",4
5045,"Montana just as I remembered the smell of those important moments, thanks",5
5051,"Narciso Rodriguez Bleu Noir Gift set is one of many I have bought from this site! I love it! It is authentic and all items on photo received upon arrival. Anywho, this perfume is very empowering with flower scent and slight musk, as its previous EDT version. Very different smell with an upgrade on its longevity. This lasts about 8 hours on my skin and sticks very well. If you want to smell like flowers, yet masculine then this is your perfume. Just to share: The bottle with cap weighs about 483 grams (~ 1 lb.). Presentation - 9/10 Beautiful Bottle Scent - 9.0/10 Gorgeous Longevity - 9.0/10 Keeps going, and going!

5078,"Wow,this is a hell of a sexy scent from Perry Ellis. Love the golden bottle,but it's kind of hard to tell how much perfume I have left,whether it's a half or quarter liter. I also can't tell what notes are in it but if I have to guess,then I'd say it's a soft floral with a touch of woods. Lasts quite long too. Love it.",5

5080,""" Philosophy Lemon Custard "", is a very nice light fragrance, especially for the summer. It's has a lemony smell and on the front of bottle, gives you a recipe for lemon Custard. This is a spritz and you will need an atomizer, very large bottle.",5

5105,"the ""Secrets by Dana"" cologne was a guess buy for me - had never heard of it, but I liked the shape of the bottle for a particular small bag I travel with, actually. I usually don't like patchouli scents in anything, but it is very faint in this cologne. Overall, it smells light and fresh and pleasant. Consider this a very light spray - scent doesn't last long - you would need to apply it 4 times throughout the day to continue to smell it.",4
5105,"Not for me, very strong smell",1
5105,"I bought Secrets by Dana without ever having smelled it before. I read the notes in it and the description and it sounded like it would be something that I would like.

5114,A really great woodsy oriental with the sweetness of vanilla. Has a warm spicy backdrop. Niche quality. It becomes milky on the dry-down. No smoke or incense in this oriental. You can definitely blind-buy this one if you like oriental fragrances.,5

5136,Very Nice and sweet smell. ,5
5136,"I bought Ungaro Party with the intention of giving it to our teenage daughter. From reviews I had read, I was sure it would be too gimmicky for me. When we got our Ungaro package back when we first ordered a few different fragrances for men and women from Ungaro, we all were shocked when I sprayed this on. It is DELIGHTFUL. I have long be a fan of Diorissimo and this has the idea of that with a tinge of fruit added to it. I absolutely love it. Although it seems to vanish shortly after I put it on, I get compliments on it for HOURS so I know that people can still smell it although it is not overpowering. I guess this one stays with me- Just bought two more!",5
5136,"Surprised that it's got one review. Purchased this perfume twice. Its among my best buys. It pulls off a different note at the start, the under notes are most amazing as you unwind the day. It's not a perfume a chicky person could appreciate but sensuous for a calm and collected person. I would redo it over and over. ",5

5220,"This is a wonderful fresh scent for the warmer months of the year. It's light and fruity with a vanilla underdone, perfect for wearing to the office or on vacation either one. It has to be reapplied during the day, but for the value it's a good deal. ",5
5220,"This is quite a wonderful scent. Just the right balance of fruity and floral so as not to be over-powering. The name ""sunset"" is quite fitting - it reminds me very much of watching the sunset on a tropical beach: sunscreen, ocean air, flowering plants, and fruity cocktails. Its wonderful to wear in the colder months to bring a sense of warmth and escape. ",5

5274,the Eau De Sisley 2 fragrance is a clean smelling fragrance but I was disappointed that it is a little too light. No one noticed I had it on unless I brought their attention to it. It is a wonderful fragrance but too faint and does not last. Too pricey for this. Will not buy again.,2
5275,"Eau De Sud is a serious citrus/herb mix. It will last 5-7 hours. While classified as a shared fragrance (unisex), it is on the masculine side. This is an honest and well crafted fragrance that I first bought in 2003 and it will not disappoint.",5

5318,One of the best fragrances I ever owned!!!,5
5318,Eau de Rhubarb Ecarlate by Hermes is a sophisticated and luxurious scent. I priced it on a cruise in duty-free shops for more than $80. I got it from Fragrance Net for $71with free shipping. The exact same product. You can't beat that.,5

5318,Excellent but wish it came in concentre to last longer,5
5323,"Guerlain Idylle Duet Jasmin Lilas is exquisite if you love lilac, which is by far, one of the most difficult scents to mimic (real lilac can't be distilled). It mingles perfectly with jasmine here, all of which is supported by woody/rose/green notes at the base. It smells like the joy of Spring's peak for that reason. It is delicate but not shrinking. It's hyper feminine, sophisticated in it's simplicity, and grown up---all of which seems rare in the sea of fruity/gourmand or ultra fresh scents nearly-unisex scents that dominate at this time. I wish I could get a body cream and shower gel to make this truly complete. ",5
5323,"Idyllic Jasmine/Lilas - Guerlain- Being a huge admirer of Lilac, but finding it near impossible to find a beautiful fragrance that can replicate it, I tried this beautiful, completely feminine scent. The Jasmine makes a perfect balancing scent, which is a mistake many companies make, blending with too heavy or strong a counterpart. It wears down to a lovely fragrance. Great fragrance.",4
5327,"It smells very old, and with a vague scent of naphtalene. I guess it doesnt go with my chemistry. However I recommend not to blind buy like I did based on reviews. Try on your skin first. ",1
5328,"I purchased this fragrance and can now admit I had to give it a chance. It is a light amber scent, much lighter than most others, and I can see now how the cedar and green tea give it balance. The first couple of times I wore it, I was expecting it to be stronger, but now that I am getting used to it, I can really appreciate how pleasant it is without being overbearing. I might even consider it a ""skin scent"" as it seems to be one of those that others around me will notice when they get within my ""bubble"", and this is nice as to not offend others but be able to enjoy the scent myself. I would encourage others to try this scent and give it some time to develop on your skin as it is pleasant without being overbearing.",5
5328,I really like J Del Pozo Ambar scent. It is a touch of woodsy and a touch of oriental combined. It is a subtle scent that is not overpowering or strong. I wore this to work and received a lot of compliments on it. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a clean scent.,5

5338,Jo Malone lime basil &mandarin cologne spray inboxed 3.4oz I really like. The smell stay with you for the most part of the day. I would order it again and recommend it to others to.,5
5338,"Jo Malone Lime Basil and Mandarin cologne is an amazingly energizing fragrance. For a cologne it lasts a pretty long time too, the basil spice note lingers for hours. Just love it! along with the Nutmeg and Ginger they are my faves",5
5343,"This perfume has a light flowery scent to it with a small citrus scent due to the green apple in it. The scent only lasts for a couple hours and you wish it had more scent staying power. Juicy Couture ""Frosty"" Couture is a perfect scent for anyone, especially if you are buying for a gift. I love the scent, I wish it lasted longer. I only rated this with four stars because the scent doesn't last long enough, otherwise I would have given it five.",5
5343,"The scent Juicy Shimmer is absolutely amazing. Lasts for hours. Only downfall---the atomizer clogs because of the shimmer inside the bottle. I am having a hard time removing the cap. I do recommend this product if it comes in splash, NOT spray.",5
5344,Cavalli is a very beautiful and potent scent.,5
5349,"Í wanted L'Eau d' Ambre Extreme from L'Artisan because i know the nose behind it is Jean Claude Ellena and there is another Ellena fragance that I adore but can not afford: Hermes Ambre Narguile. So i did my research and happens that they have both similar notes. Oriental but powdery this eau de parfum is perfect for anytime. Soft but remarkable, never overwhelming. I LOVE IT",5

5350,"L'Artisan's Nuit De Tubereuse Smelled this on a women in Italy on tour I took , it reminded be of the soap I loved in Tuscany, she told me the name and I ordered from another retailer because it wasn't stocked here yet, it was double the price. Just received my second bottle in the large size, great deal! starts off powdery and a pepper note, then I can smell citrus and rose a little bit, but the dry down is clean musky vanilla. I keep getting that scent on myself at the end of the day, Beautiful scent!",5
5351,At first I thought it was just ok but after a few months I started wearing it it Hermès d’jour everywherri went atleast one person complimented. Then I said let’s try it again... alone. It’s perfect it’s not strong but gives you a delightful reminders that’s you are wearing something special. Perfect on any day even when you are not sure what to wear this is always beautiful ,5
5351,"I did not care for the women's perfume, L'Artisian Parfumeur. You can barely smell it after you spray it.",2
5351,Do not like the women's. L'Artisan Parfumeur fragrance. Do you take returns on that? Loved the mens Sauuvage! My husband get so many complements on it.,2

5369,Lovely scent and a welcome addition to my perfume collection.,5
5372,"Its only downfall is that it doesn't come in a bigger bottle, I'm obsessed!!",5
5372,This is my third perfume within this line and it is just as beautiful. The dry down is so nice. I love smelling it on my scarf. It lingers softly. ,5
5372,Love this perfume! Powdery but not what you would think of as the norm for powdery. Men seem to love it. Two men I work with wanted to know what I was wearing because they wanted to purchase a bottle for their wives! This is a great summer perfume as it isn't heavy or sickly smelling. Makes me feel clean and fresh when I spritz it on. ,5
5372,"Lolita Lempicka L'Eau en Blanc... WOW! Sweet, powdery, & delicious, so much more than I was expecting. Long lasting without being cloying. I loooooove this one so much! I got a sample vial and I don't know how I'll survive until payday to buy the big bottle lol Forget about the description saying this is for ""younger"" women! LOVE!!!!!",5
5377,It’s very good I like it ,5

5381,"Marc Jacobs Pear, wasn’t exactly what I had anticipated. It smells delicious! You can definitely smell pear, however I feel this should be listed as unisex. I gave it to my husband and absolutely love the way it smells on him.",5
5381,"This scent is incredible. It has a lot more than just pear. It's fresh and light and subtly sweet. It's the perfect day fragrance, although I would honestly wear it all the time. I purchased this one without smelling it beforehand, but I am SO glad I did. This is my new favorite!",5
5382,I have been looking for this for years! I was so glad to finally find it. It really takes me back.,5
5382,My hubby loves Mcgregor. He’s used it since it first came out many years ago. So glad this company still carries it. He would love some after shave too if they make it.,5
5382,A lont time favorite on my man,5
5383,"Memo Paris Granada smells wonderful!! I bought a sample of this to try before committing myself to purchasing the full-size because I didn’t want to spend that much money. Let me just say that it’s worth it! You have to try this...it smells very feminine and floral, but not too floral. It’s unique...I absolutely love it!

5391,Love Love Love it smells great .,5
5391,"I would describe this as an oriental, woody scent. I think it is much more sensual than the other Muses. It it most like the original MM, but less floral and more woody. It is deep, but it is not an overpoweringly strong fragrance. It is like wrapping yourself in cashmere. It is definitely different but nice. If you like jasmine, sandalwood, and patchouli compositions in fragrance, you will enjoy this. ",5
5392,"I cannot believe this fragrance! It’s delicious! Cuir is one of the best Smokey incense scents out there and I can’t believe it’s not in the $200 - $400 range. The scent opens fresh and spicy but very quickly (after 30 seconds), turns into smoky incense. I’m not sure how this happens when there isn’t an incense note. Very masculine scent. Definitely for fall and winter!",4
5415,"It's very sweet, nice and different, I love it",4
5421,"Penhaligon's Blasted Heath is wonderful!!!!! I was a Givenchy fan but is seems to have changed to gone away, so I have been searching for a new fragrance and this was a mistake. I thought I was ordering Iris , BUT am so glad I made this mistake. It is sensual and exciting and smells VERY expensive. I feel wonderful to wear it. I spend my time in a wheelchair, so I don't get to shop except frrom the computer. This fragrance really lifts my spirits. Thank you.",5
5421,"This fragrance is magical. Recently bought it in Paris and paid twice as much. I get so many compliments on it, even from strangers. You will not be disappointed. ",5
5421,"I bought this scent in Paris a few days ago for $180. This stuff is tantalizing and sensual. A great buy at more than half the cost of what I paid. I am kicking myself right now. I , love, love, love this perfume! This is my new signature fragrance. You won’t be disappointed! ",5
5421,"Penhaglion's Blasted Heath is herbaceous, unisex, and wonderful. This is a statement scent - confidence!",5
5422,"I tried Penhaligon's Ellenisia based on an article in a magazine that recommended rose-scented perfumes. It has quickly become my favorite scent. It is just so soft and feminine. I love smelling it on my clothes, and it does seem to last throughout the day. ",5
5422,"Penhaligon's Ellenisia is one of my favorite scents. It has a soft, flowery aroma. The scent is not too strong and lasts a majority of the day. I put my on in the morning and still get subtle hints of it by the time I get home after a 12+ hour day. I highly recommend this for any woman who enjoys light, flowery scents",5

5436,"the best for evening on a date, the sent is not to strong, just right",5
5439,White flowers with a hint of nutmeg. The combination of pineapple and white flowers reminds me of toned down ylang ylang. It's a very nice scent and very different. Definitely a niche scent. ,4
5457,Scarface cologne smells just like Paco Rabanne’s 1 million. It has the same projection and longevity as well. A great alternative if you’re trying to save money. ,4
5471,"Sultre is definitely a different aroma. Reminds me of spicy smells. Once on it smells better than when you first spray it. It's a strong smell, a little bit goes a long way.",2

5488,I dearly love this fragrance! My niece gave me some last year for a gift and said this was simply made for me. My girlfriend said she was jealous cause when I walked by a handsome guy they were surely going to turn their head to check me out!,5

5513,A really great woodsy oriental with the sweetness of vanilla. Has a warm spicy backdrop. Niche quality. It becomes milky on the dry-down. No smoke or incense in this oriental. You can definitely blind-buy this one if you like oriental fragrances.,5

5550,"Amouage Blossom love is a fragrance I disliked at first sniff...and then fell in love with not long after. Now I'm mad for it, constantly sniffing my wrists and enjoying the fluffy cherry blossom rose and amaretto cloud that surrounds me. Most unusual, does not smell like anything else. Soft yet intense, exotic yet comforting. My new favourite and I'm so happy to see it at half the department store price on fabulous FragranceNet.",5
5551,Received promptly and just as ordered. Will do business with again and again!!!! Thanks ,5

5560,I've order a lot of fragrance from u and i love the prices and smell. This Angel Heart with Love by Clandestine looked so cute i can't wait to try it it's my first time i ordered this fragrance. I like to try other fragrances for fun because every fragrance smells different on others. There can be 8 women with the same fragrance in a room u can go around to each one to smell them and none r the same.,5
5560,"Smells fantastic, it last too. Its a really cute bottle w/ lil heart beads inside. Cute gift for valentine's day too;)",5

5583,"Atkinson's His Majesty The Oud is superb. 1st saw it on youtube reviews, they were all good so I googled it and again Fragrancenet had the best price. Very potent on initial spray. Give it a couple of minutes. The Oud and smokey Vanilla are wonderful. Very classy and long lasting wore it twice so far. Got a compliment both times. Would buy it again and highly recommend it. Love it. ",5
5590,Azzaro Couture is chic. Smells like a supermodel in St. Tropez! This is a pricy hard to get eau de parfum in a hand blown glass bottle decorated with 200 Austrian crystals on the lid. It can be refilled. Made of REAL perfume essences some of the most expensive to buy. A great price and a beautiful scent!,5
5592,Azzaro Twin amo esse cheiro pena que nao tem pra comprar ele grande ,5
5595,"I have tried all the flowery scents from Cartier, Chanel, YSL, Dolce Gabanna, Gucci, etc , but after I ordered Bandit .. I love it ! It's unique and at first it is indeed kinda border line masculine but after 5 minutes the scent changes into something feminine and it is indeed so captivating and very seductive ! I love and love BANDIT ! ",5
5595,Bandit is a perfume that any woman would like if she does not always need to always wear a flowery scent. Bandit is business if you're dressed in suits skirts or slacks (I especially like it with slacks) It is not sweet at all. Dry bordering on masculine. It depends on your mood and how you're feeling. I wear it when I'm feeling Take Charge. Wanna have fun of just 2. 5 stars,5
5595,For me this fragrance holds memories of my mothers wardrobe and thus is comfort and home to me...but when I wear this out not a man alive doesn't comment and woman all want the brand! One in a lifetime fragrance I will wear for all my life as my mother before me <3 ,5
5607,"I'm very glad to see black lace again. It's been quite a long time since I've used it,but somehow it's very hard to find. In my humble opinion,it's great for everyone and the price couldn't be better. Don't believe me? Go ahead & try black lace today.",5
5607,Black lace....I could not be more pleased with this fragrance. I have serious migraines and just can't tolerate strong fragrances. I'm not really bothered about the silage because most of them don't last long on me anyway. I'll most definitely buy this one again. ,5
5607,"I'm not one for expensive perfumes,although I won't mind if I get at least one,but I bought black lace on a whim just to go with my every day outfits and it's awesome. I have not heard one single negative peep out of anyone about it and I'm so glad it's not heavy or loud smelling. ",5
5607,"Black lace is not bad for a lower priced fragrance. I use it everywhere I go and I could spray as much as I want without offending anyone,because it's very light and subtle.",4
5607,"Black lace by Dana...Never heard of or seen this one before. It's a light,citrus & kind of a shower fresh scent,not overpowering in the least. Great for those with serious allergies,sinus headaches,whatever ails you sensitive ones out there. I use it in my hair by the way.",4
5609,One of the best perfumes I've had sweet and everyone asks about it. and lasts for more than 10 hours. Excellent Buy,5
5613,Smells weird at first but very pleasant in the dry down. It’s is however a very light scent. Doesn’t hold for to long. ,4
5614,It is very sexy and get lots of compliments every time I wear it!! A little goes a long way.,5
5621,"Well from first smell you realize this is trying to be Happy by Clinique. It's lighter, doesn't last as long as happy and it's not quite as refined scentwise as Happy, but it's still a very nice, clean, light citrus scent. Happy just happens to be one of the best scents ever created for men. Boss makes quality products, but i'm surprised at how hard they tried to make this like Happy. Happy is a Great cologne to try and emulate though. Overall this scent is very good for daytime spring/summer wear or at the office. Scent:8 Longevity:3 Sillage:3 Unique/Industry First:4 Quality:5 Even though it's too light to be considered a true contender to Happy, it's still a very nice, light scent. It's a safe blind buy as well. ",4
5626,ok...good product Brut After Shave,5
5644,clean black leather. it smells a lot like Fahrenheit to me. Both the EDT and deodorant stick. I love it.,4
5646,"Clean White Vetiver smells kind of dirty and off to me. It has an old stale smell in my opinion. This was a blind buy on my part, being a fan of most vetiver fragrances. Bad mistake. BTW Mugler cologne is my favorite fragrance (out of the shower clean). Clean White Vetiver is far from a clean scent.",1
5648,"This is a fragrance that compliments your every activity, i wear it to work, church, evenings out, i wear it everywhere and at anytime. Im often asked whats that fragrance your wearing, when i tell them they say, I NEVER HEARD OF THAT but i like it.....its a great scent.",1
5653,"I love CREED and This particular perfume goes on strong and dies down to such a beautiful soft finish, not overly floral. It’s warm, stays on my skin and I get compliments all the time.

5653,Delicious exotic scent. A little goes a long way. I spray it in my hair and it lasts for hours. Has a top note of incense. An intoxicating fragrance. ,5
5653,"Imperatrice Eugenia is exotic, intensely floral and long-lasting. A little goes a long way. I usually spritz it in my hair. One spray. That's it! Lasts all day. A very special fragrance. Expensive! ",5
5653,"What a captivating smell. It is classy, sexy, powerful yet very feminine. Although it has been around for over a century, it does not feel old or dated. It does not have that old lady's smell, either. I'm 29, and rocking this perfume. Little goes a long way with this one, and no reapplication is needed. I wear it the whole day, take a shower and it still refuses to come off! This is my all-time favourite, and it makes it extra special that my name is Eugenia :)",5
5654,No I do not like the smell at all. Its not my cup of tea.,1

5679,"Surprisingly good scent. I don't know why anyone hasn't bought it yet,but it's very different from everything else I've ever tried. Love the stylish denim pouch,easy to hold & very convenient for travel. Three stars? Nah,I'd give this a four only because the silage did not last too long on me.",4
5681,"When Christian Dior, Addict Shine was new (2007) I got a sample. I immediately had to have a bottle. I have been wearing it every since. The scent is light but refreshing. Bottle and sprayer are high quality. I love it!!",5

5732,WIFE LOVED THE SMELL,5
5732,"I like Fujiyama Sexy but it doesn't stay with me as long as the plain Fujiyama. The scent is pretty much the same between the two of them, but the Fujiyama Sexy ends up being more of a light powdery scent. Both of these are especially good for summer wear.",4
5732,I was turned off by the scent at first but after reapplying it it reminded me of a perfume called Rose Noir that my mom use to wear. ,4
5742,I have used Hanae Mori Blue Butterfly for years. I tried this Hanae Mori for something different. I hate it. I dislike it so much i will try to give away. There is nothing fruity or floral about it. ,1
5748,Her Secret by Antonio Bandeiras Water has more scent that this perfume...wow..very bad.. Do not waist your money buying..,1
5749,Hermes eau de neroli Dore was not at all what I expected the smell to be like... Had a strange smell to it and not at all citrus as you would expect neroli to be. ,1

5800,"This is a beautiful fragrance. I think what sets this fragrance apart from others is the hazelnut, white violet and the star anise. This is a masculine fragrance with spice and pepper. You can smell the hazelnut and anise in the dry-down ... AMAZING! This is an elegant, niche quality fragrance and I highly recommend. 10 out of 10 for me!",5
5801,"My Dad bought me Kriza Time 10yrs. ago and since I have been using it. I get compliments from both men and women, its my favorite. PLEASE do not ever discontinue it, it would break my heart.",5

5844,Masaki Fluo is a fairly refined citrus scent. It is well-blended. On my skin it disappears almost immediately. This perfume could have been in my top 10 but I'll give this one a pass in the future because it has no sillage and no lasting power.,2
5844,"Love love this scent... It's clean, crisp, and sexy . I bought this same one years ago in a mall, and couldn't find it any more. Glad I found it here!",5

5880,"Montana 80s is an incredibly creamy and softly sweet fragrance. When I first received it, I felt it was too perfume-y but that was most likely just the tuberose saying hello. Nothing lasts on my skin so I spray this on clothes and it smells incredible. It lasts for days on scarves and leaves a soft, yummy scent. I have to stop myself from wearing it every day but it has quickly become a favorite.",5
5880,"Montana 80s This fragrance was a blind-buy based on reviews online. I was not able to find it in Canada but when I saw it on clearance here, I decided to take a chance. I am so happy I did. The tuberose in this is soft and creamy. The iris makes it slightly powdery. It is a gentle, feminine scent and suits my personality. My husband loves it on me :) The bottle is more beautiful than it is portrayed in the photographs. I like that it is not a popular, well known scent since I like to smell unique. I anticipate I will be reaching for this one more often than any of the scents in my collection - it may even become my signature scent. ",5
5882,I alternate Montana Blu with Montana. This is a fresh fragrance that lasts but is subtle in nature.A very good daily fragrance that never gets old.,5
5891,"Absinthe is a wonderfully, exotic, and enchanting scent. I sometimes spray my pillow with it, I love the scent that much! Absinth by Nasomatto is that addictive. It's not an inexpensive perfume, but well worth the money. I would love to see a powder or lotion in this scent.",5
5893,"Love this cologne. I hadn't even smelled this, but I saw it and decided to buy it for my boyfriend, brother, and dad since they're all huge Miami Heat fans. When they finally sprayed it on, I was so surprised by what a nice scent it was. Just wish it had a little more lasting power. Besides that, smells great for day or evening wear and can't beat the price. Makes a great gift!",4
5894,"I bought this fragrance blind because I like Nicole Miller as a designer and the price was very competitive. I'm glad I did! It's a great, cool, manly, fragrance for going out in the evening. The bottle also looks better in real life than in the picture - it does not look out of place next to the couple of other high end and expensive fragrances I have in my cabinet.",5
5907,"Earthy smell, almost incense like. Not overpowering scent. ",4
5907,I really like the peris hilton passport perfume. It smells great. ,4
5907,you smell is good.,4
5907,It smells like honey. Unless you wanna smell like honey,4
5909,"I love this smell ! I""m Thankfull for Fragance .net ",5
5909,"I love this fragrance,falling in love the first day I sense this perfume,I'm so glad I brought from fragrance net,and I'll always,",5
5911,"Penhaligon's Orange Blossom is a lovely fragrance, soft, creamy, perfect for everyday.",5
5912,"You will stand out with this one. You will get the ""is that you"" comment and then they ask where can they get it from.",5
5912,"Great juice, I love it",5
5912,"Even though Penhaligon listed it as a women's fragrance I took Fragrance Net's word for it and bought it as a unisex scent. It's great. It doesn't smell feminine at all, it's fresh and not overpowering. Definitely a keeper.",5
5912,"I can’t tell you how many times people have literally stopped me in public to ask me what perfume I have on. I love Blasted Bloom. I find it fresh and clean and not too sweet or overpowering. I have been searching for a perfume for years, and this is it. Honestly, people stop me all the time and tell me how wonderful I smell. ",5
5912,Penhaglion' Blasted Bloom is unlike any fragrance I have ever come into contact with. Like origami it unfolds into different scents on your skin as the day goes by. Every body chemistry will experience this fragrance differently. It is not for the timid but for someone who is self-assured and confident. It is a little pricey but is well worth it in every drop or spray.,5
5913,Very old and elegant fragance designed for masculine and well dressed gentlemen. ,5
5913,"Penhaligon's Hammam Bouquet was introduced nearly 150 years ago as a fragrance for men but I suspect this would be considered strictly a feminine fragrance now, except for the most confident and elegant of men who could, indeed, carry this off. For women though, Hammam Bouquet is a grand incense and sweet rose fragrance with a rich, woody base. Reminds me most of Hermes' Rouge with its churchy incense feeling. Very respectable longevity. A complex fragrance that's refreshingly different from current florals and fruity/candy fragrances smelled everywhere on everyone.",5
5917,Powerful is exactly that instant mind control over the ladies with this one.,5
5917,This is a great masculine smell that I can smell on my husband all day long.,5
5935,"I REALLY LIKE POLICE QUEEN TO BE, SMELL IS NICE AND ALL THEIR PRODUCTS ARE REALLY GOOD",5
5935,"Make no mistake, this is a daring scent! Police has other scents that are a bit more floral and feminine but this one is striking. Unique, somewhat unisex tbh, in the sense that it isn’t an obvious feminine smell. You get the sweet, fruity vibes but the musk of it all actually hits harder than your average female fragrance. It’s what I like about it. It’s bold, strong and not your typical fragrance DNA. This would be something to wear if you were looking to command the room. Perhaps a work event for the lady in charge. The name couldn’t be more fitting for the occasion that this would pair best with, To Be The Queen of the night!",5
5935,"I just love the Police to be Perfume I just got!! It has a nice sophisticated classic scent to it. I just adore the cute skull bottle, it is just adorable, I just received the Police to be Woman perfume which comes in a purple colored glass bottle.",5
5937,porsche design is my every day fragrance I get compliments all the time This web site has the best prices,5
5955,"Bought Repetto when I went to Paris. Loved the fragrance. When got back home, I looked for Repetto in all the high end stores and found that they did not carry it anymore. So the only place I can find it is online. Thanks for still carrying my favorite fragrance.",5
5956,"I bought this van cleef Reve Elixir on a wing and a prayer, thank God I followed my mind...This perfume has a sexy smell that make you feel good on a bad day...the initial spray I put on instantly put me in a romantic mood , I highly recommend this one to the grown and sexy women.",5
5963,"Love Scaasi, used it back in the 90's and my adult children remembered the scent. Wasn't sure if it was the real thing because I got it at such a good price three times less than I paid back in the early 90's. So impressed with the product and pricing I immediately made another purchase, waiting for it to arrive. All I can say is WOW, I am impressed.",5
5963,"If you're like me and love wonderful smells this should surely be sitting on your vanity/dresser!! I discovered Scassi 25 + years ago, fell in love with the scent and have worn it ever since! Last Christmas I gave it as a gift to my sister and she also now loves the scent! I hope since on clearance that you are not going to stop selling!! I will be searching for another site that carries Scassi!!! ",5

5974,amazing! it smells sweet and then drys down to a sexy masculine sweet smell,5
5978,I was given Society many years ago but have not used it as I seem to stick to White Linen. I used Society last weekend for my 55th wedding anniversary party and was surprised at the number of comments of how nice I smelled. Will definitely order when I use what I have.,5
5980,"HEAVENLY.. Brilliant combination of cedre wood, honey, rose, pachouli, oud and some sort of spices.. I feel there is silent bit of clary sage or something or that sort that is silent..

5994,Excellent. Franck Olivier never fails. Excuisit perfume in a most reasonable price. Highly recommended!,5
5997,"I bought this wonderful perfume when I was in Europe this past summer. First I bought a small bottle of it in Paris. While in Paris, I put it on and I got some many compliments from strangers. I then went to Milan, Italy and saw a large bottle which I bought. It is such a fresh fragrance that you will never smell on anyone other than yourself. It is a little expensive, however , I don't mind paying more if the perfume is wonderful and this one is superb!! ",5

6038,I like the original Bombshell and LOVE the Bombshell Paris which VS discontinued. I hadn't seen this one on their site so was glad to see it here and wanted to give it a try. I like it! It has a nice floral smell and I layer it with the original Bombshell. I get lots of compliments at work and would definitely buy again.,4
6046,Just got this today smells wonderful . Smells like an Aqua di gio with a slight wood or spice maybe grapefruit will buy again,5
6046,Reminds me of the Cool Water cologne but more pronounced!! Pleasant scent !! I would wear as a regular or signature scent like I would wear Aqua Di Gio as a signature scent. My daughter-age 14 and my fiance -40 loved the scent! Wear daily to work or out for fun.,4
6047,Whatever it takes George Clooney was bought for me as a gag gift. Honestly it sat on my counter for two months till the one who gifted it to me dropped by. I gave it a small spritz and immediately realized it actually smelled great. I would receive several compliments that evening. It’s light but masculine. It has very nice notes that fade very slowly so it is an exceptional cologne for and evening out or business casual. Don’t be put off by the goofy art work by George Clooney on the packaging it’s an excellent cologne.,4
6052,"Wow! I just fell in love with Windsor. I picked it for my husband as his birthday git last year without knowing the smell. He came from vacation and wear it to go to church. when he came to say thank you I had to ask: what are you wearing? huummm! you smell so good. He looked at me surprised saying: what are you talking about? that's the parfum you bought for me. I was like oh! my God and gave him a kiss.

6096,"This is the best perfume every woman or lady on this earth should wear.. I just don’t know how to define this fragrance.

Very lovely scent and very long lasting . All day. Trust me, you will love it. ",5
6096,"Beloved is a really pretty scent and very different from other Amouage scents that I have tested.. Easy to wear and alway appropriate; Work, casual or dress. This scent is a staple in any perfume collection. An instant love for me. Very feminine, soft, refined florals and creamy green herbals. There is oud, of course, it's an Amouage scent but so beautifully done. I hate putting an age on perfume but I would guess people from age 30 and up would appreciate this beauty. ",5
6100,"Amouage Interlude Superb, very elegant, long lasting spicy oriental smell, just divine It is strong and different than any other perfumes very distinctive.... not suitable for every occasion only evening / special occasions.

White flowers, jasmin and green leaves, best worn in hot weather. You'll get lots of compliments while wearing it from both sexes. Simply divine.",5
6112,"I just got my miniature today, and I really like it! It's a milky, green, citrusy concoction. I am not familiar with how a fig leaf smells, to me, it has a tiny bit of tropical, coconutty sweetness. Very unique!",5

6177,"Bruno Banini became my favorite when a friend in Germany gave it to me as a gift. I am 60 years old but didn't want to smell like ""an old lady"" and this fragrance was perfect. The woman who gave it to me was in her late 40's. ",5
6198,"I love Cheeky Alice it’s hard to find such a beautiful light fresh fragrance, people often ask me what I’m wearing as they love it because it’s not overpowering. I’ve also tried to find the other one that Vivienne Westwood makes Naughty Alice but having great difficulty unless they’ve stopped making it, both are very nice.",5
6198,It is a good day time sent. It won't over power you or the people around you. I don't want the whole place to turn around as I walk into the door. I like when someone is talking to me and wants to stay around. Once in a while someone will ask what I am wearing. ,5

I have received many compliments on this while wearing it anywhere, but I prefer it for the evening or for a date. Only 1 or 2 sprays is required from this for a nice long lasting fragrance and I don't like to project it a lot. I like people to be near me to smell it and I have had to fend people off from me, that is how good it is. I am glad it is still around and need to stock up on it in case it is discontinued. I love it!",5

6283,"Impulse buy. It was on sale and already cheap, so I said ""what the hey?""... Kind of strong, woodsy scent. Doesn't last long, but don't make the mistake of dousing yourself.

The beeswax is sweet but not sickly sweet but on my skin zero tobacco showed up. This is a fresh clean laundry scent with hint of honey sweetness (clean not dirty). It would be good layered with other Jo Malone fragrances but can be worn alone. ,3
